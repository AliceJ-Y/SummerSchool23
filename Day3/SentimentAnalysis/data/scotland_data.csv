But the division of this place, the politics the arrogance of the SNP and other parties, the sheer incompotence of the goverment in managing Scotland, which since devolution, has made no difference, if anything, worse.

The people, aggro all the time, only absolutes, you're YES or you're a tory piece of shit/worst of humanity. 

The constant 1 up-man-ship. 
Cost of living is mental, house prices are absurd, no ability for either goverment to hold accountability or insight. 

The councils, underfunded and left to rot, dogshit on the streets, fly tipping.

Motorhomes registered to pensioners and independence figureheads in bed with russians, with people actually choosing to vote Alba due to SNP failings- their own lack of insight and feverous hatred, looking to blame westminsters politicians for their shit lives caused by their own shit choices.

The NHS, lets not even get started, devolved to an incompetent bunch of arseholes, only interested in patting their own banks and kissing their own arses, which has left us fucked.

7,"Cue the Dougie McLean hit…

It’s 4 years since we packed up the family in Stonehaven and moved to Dorking in Surrey. For the most part, it has been a good move for us. I was in a cycle of new job&gt;redundancy/liquidation that was getting unbearable. Our mountain biking group of friends had fallen apart (sadly lost one of the old gang recently to suicide). Stonehaven was looking and feeling bleak. Our families are in Dundee and Perth, so we even felt a bit isolated from them. As my work is Revit/CAD/3D modelling for building services (with a stint of oil and gas whist in the Aberdeen area), most of the work out there was London. We took the decision to have a fresh start. I flew down for 2 interviews in one day and came away that night with 2 offers. For the most part it has been great - I’ve managed to get Ltd Company contracting in some really interesting projects. The boy is really enjoying school. The new one that came along is loving nursery. We have a great group of friends and the mountain biking scene in Dorking is amazing. Dorking itself is a great wee town too. But nothing could prepare me for just how busy the SE is! Thankfully the biking in the Surrey Hills is amazing and we don’t need to drive anywhere but my god it’s a mission if you actually want to have a wee daytrip over 20 miles away. 

The biggest cultural shock for me as a lover of most outdoor pursuits is the absence of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Id never heard of a ‘bridleway’ until 4 years ago and never considered that you can’t ride a bike on a ‘footpath’. I got shouted at recently for riding with the kids on a footpath. What?! You mean  I can’t ride on this path that is wide enough and smooth enough to drive a bus down?! Madness! This also affects the other stuff I’d taken for granted - wild swimming, canoeing, wild camping etc. This will never change in this archaic Tory-loving country. 

So between that and doing a few more hours work most nights to pay for this ludicrous cost of living you’ll get an idea of how stifled I’m starting to feel. We’re starting to consider moving to the Glasgow area, possibly East Dumbartonshire mostly for the easy access to the hills for biking (and everything else I’m allowed to do!) and back towards family in Perth and Dundee. I’m actually starting to get quite excited about it! I’ve always really liked Glasgow and kind of wished I’d bypassed this whole thing and just moved that direction 4 years ago. But, ‘experiences’ etc.

The one problem is I have no idea how to even begin moving the boy out of/into school mid-term! He’s in Year 2 (Primary 3 in real money). It just seems like a chicken-egg-chicken situation. Anyone that has done the combined house-job-school move have any tips on where to begin?

12,"By Lesley Riddoch 

As the dust settles on the arrest, tent, police raid, and tabloid search for a glimpse of Nicola Sturgeon or Peter Murrell, the Easter break has given everyone a chance to look around a bit.

For independence supporters the situation may look bleak, as even the SNP’s interim CEO Mike Russell says; “I don’t think independence can be secured right now; we need to work towards some co-ordinated campaigning” with a “new Yes movement.”

Independence is the life blood of the SNP, the reason members join and campaigners chap doors and distribute leaflets each election time. So, does that admission mean the SNP is terminally damaged? No – or at least not yet.

Support for independence is remarkably steady and a new, joint, concerted campaign might just appeal to Yessers, so long as it’s 100% genuine and speedily delivered. But more importantly, the SNP is still the only game in town for Scots who’ve given up on Westminster. And that’s a lot of people. Besides it isn’t the only party with problems.

Saturday’s Tory-supporting Telegraph proclaimed “Tory fury as Douglas Ross says Scots should vote Labour to oust SNP” – a position party chairman Craig Hoy MSP implausibly denied his boss had actually taken on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show.

Analysts predict the Tories are set for a drubbing in the English local elections and another Tory MP has been caught trying to sell his wares in a Times sting.

The Daily Mail columnist Richard “no friend to the Nats” Littlejohn has suggested 20 cops arriving for a dawn raid at the Sturgeon/Murrell home was over the top. Meanwhile, talk of a leadership re-run or a sub-party forming at Holyrood should be tempered by the fact of Kate Forbes’ daily tweets supporting Humza Yousaf. She may be playing a waiting game but internal opposition will find it hard to coalesce around an alternative leader who doesn’t challenge the newly elected incumbent.

Still, the SNP and Scottish Government face massive challenges – there’s no escaping the fact. It’s just that switching support to (probably) Labour means accepting a British state that shows no signs of being able to confront or reform itself. Au contraire.

You don’t need to be a card-carrying Republican to feel slightly nauseous as faux Coronation excitement ramps up daily. It seems we should suspend criticism of the million-pound event since community activists will replace z-list dignitaries at the event. Huzzah. We should be chuffed that in a cost-of-living crisis, King Charles has designed a “scaled down” event with just one new gold carriage and two new thrones which will last 90 minutes not the three hours spent on Queen Elizabeth’s ceremony in 1953.

Still, while the British and international press trills about the chance for a moment of coronation togetherness, Scotland stands with one eyebrow collectively arched.

Shetland is still the only council to vote against a bank holiday for staff on the May coronation weekend – happily, national holidays in Scotland are determined by councils. But in Westminster-run Northern Ireland, local elections have been postponed by two weeks to avoid a clash. Yip, a month after celebrations of the democratic breakthrough achieved by the Good Friday Agreement 25 years ago, local democracy must take second place to the coronation of an unelected head of state.

And bizarrely that’s quite unremarkable in an archaic British state half of Scotland would leave but most of Scotland would reform. A Panelbase poll in December 2022 found 55% of Scots would prefer an independent Scotland to be a republic rather than headed by King Charles – a result which aligns Scotland with Europe where 21 of 27 EU member states are republics with elected heads of state.

Even amongst the six European monarchies, Britain is an outlier – the only country still conducting an actual coronation ceremony. European monarchies have either replaced them with simpler events (like Denmark) or never practised coronations (like the Netherlands and Belgium). Indeed, most monarchies today just require a simple oath taken in the country’s legislature. But hey Britain – simple? That’s not what monarchy is about.

Rory Scothorne suggests the British royal family is not just regal eye-candy but “indicates to subjects that Britain is not like other states, and thus need not be held to similar standards. By proving we do things differently here, [the monarchy] helps us avoid the realisation that we actually do things worse. It is royalty, above all, that makes Britain’s conservative constitution popular.” Maybe, in England but not with Scots.

One month before C-Day, Scots have far fewer street parties planned than the rest of the UK – though of course, spontaneity might yet kick in. Still, last year only 14 events were held in Scotland to celebrate 70 years of the Queen on the throne. Across the UK, there were 16,000. When it comes to the cowed reverence and Union Jack emblazoned excitement that accompanies royalty, Scots tend to back the Bard: “The rank is but the guinea’s stamp, The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.”

The Panelbase poll did find 45% of Scots would keep the monarchy in an independent country, but I suspect they’d expect a seriously pared-down European-style monarchy – which clearly ain’t what “frugal” Charles is planning. This is just one part of the obsequious, foreluck-tugging reality Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party must tackle or meekly endorse. Which will it be?

We already know the answer. Ditto with all the other big issues. What chance a return to full-blooded public ownership beyond railways that are already halfway there, and the bantamweight arrival of Great British Energy to compete on the sidelines while the billion pound profit-making BP and Shell rock on? None.

What chance of a return to the EU or at least the single market? None

What chance of an end to the ramped up anti-immigrant rhetoric that fuelled the recent attack on an asylum seeking hotel? Some, but the virility test for the Labour leader will be keeping the horrific Rwanda deportation route open and stopping more boats on the Channel.

Indeed, what chance vigorous, open debate on these and other vital issues while an unofficial policy of “wheesht for a Labour Government” is operating? Monica Lennon MSP admitted as much last week as she joined the chorus of criticism over Labour’s attack ads, signed off by Keir Starmer, which claim Rishi Sunak doesn’t think child sex abusers should go to prison. Until now wheeshting was only for indy. Actually, everyone does it.

Scotland is waiting to see what arises from Peter Murrell’s arrest. Clearly, Humza has it all to do. But so does everyone else who would unseat him.",Troubled SNP is the only game in town for Yes supporters,2023-04-10 11:08:37

They recently had a conversation with their landlord, in which the landlord informally informed them that the buy to let mortgage doubled in the last 12 months and they would have to evict my friend and sell the property in the near future because they cannot increase the rent and they are losing money. The mortgage is now almost double the rent my friend is paying.

But oh, the landlord had a “convenient little solution” and that’s where it goes wrong. If the tenant (no pressure) voluntarily made an offer to pay a slightly higher rent then that would save some time and that way the tenant can keep living there for longer. 

Like if the my friend turned around and said “oh you poor landlord, I know you’re struggling, I am too. So I want to pay you more, I don’t care about myself, I care about you”. It is obvious that no tenant would do this without being forced into it. Which defeats the purpose of the rent freeze if there is this big red flag of a loophole. Landlords can easily say “voluntarily offer us a higher rent or out you go. But do it voluntarily, it’s your idea not mine”. If they refuse then evict them, put the property on the market for a month to look like you want to sell, then “oh, changed my mind” and rent it at a higher price.

My friend is faced with 2 options now: agree to this solution and do as told regardless of the legality of things. Or await an eviction notice and find an other place, which will cost more because of other buy to let landlords doing something similar and putting properties on the market way above a living rent.

Posting this mostly to give everyone in Scotland a new years laugh. Some fun parts

&gt;Even at Westminster Brexit is a topic politicians prefer to avoid. The ruling Conservatives tend to skirt it because leaving the EU has clearly not delivered the benefits they foresaw. Keir Starmer and his shadow cabinet treat Brexit as the Great Unmentionable for fear of alienating the Leave-voting Red Wall seats that Labour needs to win the next election.

My heart goes out to the English politicians ruining the UK because they're too scared to be honest under the FPTP system Labour and the Tories force on us like a cartel so they can cycle between themselves.

Speaking of the 'Great Unmentionable', I am once again asking for a single Scottish journalist to ask Sarwar why Scottish Labour are now a Brexit party?

&gt;It is true that the opinion polls have shown support for Brexit diminishing as the cost-of-living crisis has deepened, but the headlines are misleading. That support has fallen not because millions of Leavers have suddenly decided they voted the wrong way, but because they think the government has failed to exploit Brexit – not least by curbing immigration. Hence Nigel Farage’s recent threat to re-enter the political fray: “I spent a quarter of a century fighting for us to get Brexit, but I simply couldn’t stand aside and do nothing if this act of betrayal continues.”

Oh no, apparently a portion of England will go full gammon again and take votes from the Tories and Labour to vote for Farage/racism... whatever will we do about that 😱 Best get Sir Keir Starmer out stating too many foreigners are in the NHS and Rachel Reeves declaring more deportations are needed.

&gt;Suppose leading Remainers were unequivocally to state the obvious – that we will not seek another referendum for at least a generation; that the EU would not let us rejoin right now even if we voted to (and certainly not on the terms we previously enjoyed); and that not all the Brexiteers’ nostrums are wrong-headed. Levelling up, for example, is a laudable aim, as is weaning British industry off its dependence on cheap imported labour. 

Ah yes, democracy must stop for a period of time because people aren't allowed to change their minds if they feel they were lied to. Wonder where we've heard that one before 🤔

What is it with Brits and throwing toys out the pram if people on this island might be up for changing their mind? Or new electorate members come of age and want to send their parents to the shadow realm for screwing up their futures? Boomer tier pish that democracy has to stop for periods of time.

&gt;I also believe, as we enter 2023, that the mass of the British people are exhausted by the battles of the past six years and yearn to move on.

Job prospects. This goes for both of us. Currently she works in a bank and I work as a carer, but I'm looking to change that soon. If times got tough I could pick up care shifts on the side with an agency, as I do have the qualifications.

Access to community/support. In my case job prospects would factor in here, too as the ideal job I'm aiming for would be a counsellor specialising in LGBT+ based support. It was also the main topic of that previous thread. A lot of people pointed out potential resources to me but I'm wondering what area would still have the best access.

Access to public transportation. Neither of us drive, so this is a big one. She grew up in Dublin so never really needed a car, whereas I get a bit too anxious behind the wheel. Would consider going back and finishing my lessons if there was no other option, though.

53,"The supreme court ruling today was, I think, pretty much expected and basically means there'll be no IndyRef in 2023, unless Sunak somehow changes his mind.

I'm very sure the SNP were expecting this too, I don't know what specifically they will plan to do next, other than the de-facto referendum, but these are some suggestions I have.

Sturgeon said today, the next step would be to look for the next thing that gives Scotland a chance to have their say, which would be the 2024/5 General Election (unless something unprecedented happens like a snap Holyrood/Westminster Election, or idk a referendum for a referendum lol). That means there's 2 more years before anything can happen.

In that time, the Scottish Government must build up support for independence. 

Potentially very controversial, but its all very good to say Scotland is being ignored however the reality is that polling doesn't support the claim that a majority want Scottish independence. If support for independence was made consistently high as it had been during the 2020-21 period, a mandate for a referendum would be impossible for Westminster to ignore.

There's a few ways this can be achieved, but the biggest shifts in opinion, IMO, will come from:

- 1. A **detailed**, costed, economic prospectus for independence. This would be difficult to gauge, but it's what's needed. People want numbers and hard figures, not promises. And that prospectus, if done correctly, would probably show a tough initial period, but the SNP/ Yes campaign should own that with confidence, show that they know the challenges and perhaps show what they will do to offset it as much as they can. Honesty and humility will go a long way.

They have 2 years to make an incredibly detailed paper. 

- 2. Better governance than Westminster. May be a bit obvious, but the whole reason behind the 2020-21 increase in independence support was that it was perceived that Scotland was performing better than Westminster, and had better leadership is response to the pandemic. 

In this cost of living crisis, achieving the same will go a _long_ way. I know Holyrood is limited in its powers but it must do whatever it can. Giving nurses a good enough pay deal and avoiding NHS strikes, giving teachers a good enough pay deal, giving rail workers a good enough pay deal, showing that Scotland listens to key workers. The UK Health Secretary is refusing to even engage in any conversation with the nurses planning to strike, that clear divide in attitude should be made even more stark.

Breaking the deadlock is what is needed in the next step of the independence campaign.

Obviously many other things that SNP / Yes campaign will need to do, but those are Two of the biggest things that will shift opinion, IMO.

Now, I'm just some random guy on reddit, my opinion on what is needed doesn't matter to the independence campaign, but I believe this route is the only possible way to an independence referendum _and_ a Yes win.

Let me know if you disagree, or agree, what other suggestions you may have. Happy to have a discussion. :)",The next steps for an IndyRef,2022-11-23 16:47:15

&gt;  
The turmoil that sprang from Liz Truss’s mini-budget boosted faith in the economic case for Scottish independence, according to a poll.  
&gt;  
&gt;Voters were equally optimistic about their fortunes in the event of a break-up of the UK as they would be about remaining in the status quo, according to research for Ipsos. Its survey found 43 per cent of the population believed Scotland’s economy would be better off after independence, exactly the same proportion as those who favoured the prospects of the United Kingdom. Ten per cent said it would make no difference and 4 per cent were unsure.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Nicola Sturgeon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/nicola-sturgeon?page=1) has sought in recent months to capitalise on the chaos wrought by the [mini-budget](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mini-budget-panic-may-be-spreading-to-property-funds-vhfd96k35) of September 23, which included £45 billion of unfunded taxcuts and led to pandemonium in the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel survey, which was carried out last month during the dying days of Truss’s premiership, found that the public in Scotland and across the UK were increasingly gloomy about their economic prospects as the cost of living escalated.  
&gt;  
&gt;In all four nations, people were more likely to think the economies of the rest of the Union would be worse off — (37 per cent) than better off (20 per cent) [if Scotland became independent](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/scottish-independence?page=1), according to the research. It found that a higher proportion, 45 per cent, of people in Scotland thought that the remaining UK economies would be worse off in the event of secession.  
Emily Gray, the managing director of Ipsos Scotland, said: “With the [cost of living crisis](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/welcome-to-the-new-normal-0dvkwdrkg) deepening, most people expect gloomy economic times ahead and the measures that governments at both Holyrood and Westminster set out over the coming months to help weather the crises may well shift public views on Scotland’s economic future further.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The economic uncertainty of starting a new country — particularly around [Scotland’s notional deficit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/so-all-we-need-now-is-the-luck-of-flashman-9505x0mqk), the fiscal transfer from the UK government and trade — has been one of the key arguments made for the Union.  
&gt;  
&gt;Previous polls had suggested that even the plunging value of the pound and a Bank of England bailout for pensions in the wake of Truss unveiling her economic plans had done little to shift the dial around independence up until this point.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Rishi Sunak ](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/rishi-sunak?page=1)will hope that the [autumn statement](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/autumn-statement-2022-jeremy-hunt-tax-rishi-sunak-latest-news-9d8gbsl0p), to be delivered tomorrow, will present a more stable vision for the UK’s economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a referendum next October but is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether Holyrood has the power to call a vote without Westminster’s agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first minister has published three papers setting out her prospectus for a new country and has made much of the UK’s economic turmoil in an effort to entice people towards independence. Writing in the Financial Times yesterday she said that an “inherently weak and unstable economic model seems now to be hardwired into the UK’s future”.  
&gt;  
&gt;She added: “One thing is already clear — to build a more prosperous and fairer future, Scottish independence is not only desirable, it is now essential.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Confidence in the UK’s economy dropped among the Scottish public with 80 per cent expecting the general economic condition of the UK to worsen in the next 12 months, compared with 73 per cent in February.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to Scotland’s economic prospects, the public are also pessimistic with 73 per cent expecting Scotland’s general economic condition to deteriorate over the year ahead, compared with 68 per cent earlier this year.

&gt;[Pamela Nash](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/4-2bn-navy-deal-shows-value-of-union-say-tory-msps-f2fp6cxqx), the chief executive of Scotland in Union, the anti-independence campaign group, said: “People in Scotland categorically do not want a referendum any time soon, and we know that the answer to the economic challenges we are facing does not lie in creating more chaos by having indyref2 or breaking up the UK.

Unpopular opinion time. 

I am getting fed up with all these people striking in the public sector. Yes it sucks that cost of living is through the roof but you are now begining to harm everyone, which I know is the point of the strike until you get your way. 

Plenty of people out there getting no pay rises or certainly not anywhere near 5%. 

There comes a point where enough is enough. 

And the line has to me made at ScotRail for me. 

Do I think that extra money should be found for the NHS pay rises? Of course. 

But the train system is failing due to its unreliability and cost. It failed as a private business and has gone nationalised. If it was still privately owned, there would be job losses and cut backs.  

This strike will have an impact on every business in the cities as Christmas trade suffers. It will have an impact on people's mental health as they can unwind from their jobs at weekends, such as supporting the national team at Murray field or getting to the pub. 

It's completely selfish and I really hope that the government hold fast and make an example of them.

&gt;The Resolution Foundation said such a switch would have stark consequences for families struggling with soaring living costs. A single disabled adult on universal credit would lose £380, while a working single parent with one child would lose £478, and a working couple with three children would lose £978.
&gt;

Initially, the SNP Government tried to pin the blame on Edinburgh’s Labour-run council, but that strategy unravelled when workers in a string of other local authorities walked out too. Nor is there yet an end in sight. This week, unions rejected an offer of a 5% pay rise, plus a one-off payment for lower earners, saying it would do too little to help the half of Scottish council workers who are paid less than £25,000pa. Scotland is in the midst of a summer of discontent, next week, schools and nurseries will close for three days as a result of strikes by cleaners and other support staff.

**Energy:** We will be coming to the end of our fixed rate soon after moving in.

**Mortgage:** If our house isn't built by the time our mortgage offer is valid until then we will need to reapply and will easily cost a few extra £100 a month. 

**All other money:** Just been saving it for the move.

Once we move all of our bills are set to rise, but we took that into account at the time and made sure that we wouldn't be on the breadline. Things have changed a bit since our original figures.

Everything is on the rise, and while we are in a relatively good position, I am worried about the future. We will have enough to get by month to month, and if we save for a few months we will maybe even be able to go on a holiday. 

But what if the washing machine breaks? What if the car needs repairing, what if our dog falls ill and the insurance doesn't cover it? What about my friends and family that are already on the breadline? What about my family that has already decided that they just won't pay energy bills this winter and face the backlash at another time? Why is anyone having to make these sorts of decisions?

I'm sick of seeing headlines and videos pop up that are just a pissing contest between politicians, or companies posting record profits. Or the bank of england raising their interest rates while putting out a statement that they know that some people are finding the cost of living tough. 

It always feels like it's an ""us versus them"" situation all the time. Tories vs Labour, Holyrood vs Westminster, Rich vs Poor, Scotland vs England. Could we not just fuck up a bit and figure out what is objectively better for everyone?

I'm from Galway Ireland and I've been thinking of moving to Scotland.  
I visited Edinburgh with a few mates earlier this year, loved it.  
Also just so happened to be one of the hottest days of the year.   


Before that Edinburgh was high up in my list, and it still is.  
But it was also really expensive, not even accounting for rent.

Cost of living is a big consideration.

I'm starting in Sales over here but I'm not convinced I want to continue to work in sales..

Glasgow was also recommended to me.  
I've heard its got a great music scene and that's big plus for me.  
I want to get involved in the music scene, I want to continue to write songs and perform.  
My music tastes include - Lewis Capaldi, Paolo Nutini, Jason Isbell, Gregory Alan Isakov, Tyler Childers, Johnny Cash, John Mayer etc.

So as a 20 something, recent graduate budding musician, where would you move?

Im a EU citizen (Im from Sweden), currently living in Brighton (for the last 10 years) and I have had enough.
I dont have any real ties to Brighton, and am looking at places around UK to move to.

So, asking you all for suggestions, I prefer not one of the large cities, rather smaller towns but still not too small if hat make sense. A long the cost would be a big plus, I have heard (and seen) you got some really nice beaches. I have a dog, hence why some nature close by this time would be nice, rather than smack middle of a large city.

I'm not sure which one, or perhaps it doesn't matter?, airport has the best connections to and around Europe. Always a plus to be relatively close to airport and even better, trains. I prefer trains.

141,"I know this is me preaching to the converted but I seriously need to vent, I am in Edinburgh and what Labour is doing here is something straight out of an Alba voter's conspiracy theory.

They are leaving the SNP-Labour coalition in favour of forming one with the LibDems and Tories, the latter part has majorly pissed off a lot of people, including Lab voters, because in this city, when we went to vote, we had stuff like spaces for people, schools, investment in the capital, the cost of living crisis, and superlandlords on our mind. What we Didn't have in mind, was whether or not the party WANTED TO FUCK A BUTCHER'S APRON AND HIDE THEIR ACCENTS IN FRONT OF THEIR OVERLORDS.

The SNP and Greens were open to a left-wing coalition with Labour, despite the independence disagreement. But no, no that cunt of a leader Cammy Day loves Boris Johnson's cock more than air, so he's planning a deal with the Tories, who may I remind/inform you, were the only party against spaces for people which they labelled as a ""war on cars"" meanwhile Labour were gesturing at continuing environmental initiatives. Also keep in mind that the Tories ended up dead last, losing half their seats, the Greens outperformed them, the city firmly said No to the Tories' message, and they are essentially being rewarded for losing and Lab is going against the wishes of even Their Own voters.

What the actual fuck are they thinking, they have the gall to say ""NaTs R oObSeSsEd WiTh InDepUnDanCE"" yet what I see here, is the yoon parties who are being obsessed. Independence has nothing, I repreat, NOTHING to do with local politics, fuck all, nada, rien, nichts, ni sam bith. So tell me, if Labour are supposedly so upset at the SNP and Nicky being ""obsessed with independence"" why are they making a choice that very much gestures at them being so obsessed with independence they're rather side with a right-wing party?

It is not, and this is proof. If Labour and the Toris chum up in England, it will be the start of the fucking Biblical Armageddon, here it's buisness as usual.

The one small silver lining in this shit storm is inflation is expected to fall to 2% after 2 long years. 

“There is more than one reason why the rate of inflation is so high now. 

It started to rise in 2021 and that was partly to do with the economy recovering from the Covid crisis. 

Economies around the world, including in the UK, opened up after Covid restrictions eased. And then people naturally wanted to start buying things again.

But businesses selling some of those things couldn’t get enough of them to their customers. This caused prices to rise - especially for goods coming from abroad.

Added to that, there was a very sharp rise in energy (oil and gas) prices. All of these things pushed prices (and the rate of inflation) up.

In early 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to more large increases in the price of things like energy and food. 

The lockdowns in China (due to Covid) are also making it harder to import some goods to the UK. So that is pushing up prices too. 

These two factors explain the large majority of the increase in inflation.”

155,"
I’ve just read a story about an 11 year old boy that asked if a plumber, already at his charitably, would like to buy his PlayStation so that his Mum and Dad could afford to eat with him.

I’m heart broken, the Tories are always banging on about the UK being the fastest growing economy in the G7 (proven lie), and being the world’s 5th largest economy- so how does it get like this?

How do we have 2.5 million people needing to use foodbanks?

A number set to grow even higher, experts at the Trussell trust think that nearly 1 in 10 parents are veru likely to use food banks within the next three months.
Almost 20% of parents in the last year have gone without food to make sure their child has enough to eat.

People are already reporting that they can no longer afford to use their oven’s because the cost of energy is extortionate.

And some food banks are asking people not to donate ropt vegetable and potatoes because people cannot afford the longer cooking times these need to undergo.

The government has totally outsourced its moral obligation to provide for the people they govern to the charity of those same people.

They needed to be shamed and publicly pressured to provide free school meals to children during Covid, and promptly outsourced that to a Tory donor who provided woefully inadequate amounts and qualities of food, and then pocketed the difference.

The UK might have one of the worlds largest economies but the vast majority of that wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people. The wealthiest 10% control 43% of the wealth, the wealthiest 1% controls almost 25% of all of the wealth of the UK.
Meanwhile the least well off 50% control only 9%.

This income inequality is growing, as the government strips more and more publicly owned services, selling them off to “preferred bidders”, classmates from university/ private schools/ companies they own shares in.

12 year of Tory Austerity, corruption, cronyism, law breaking, lying, and outright theft has left the country on the brink.

The cost of living crisis is getting worse, food prices, fuel prices, energy prices, are all set to rise, but wages are stagnant, and, rather than take a cut in profits the huge businesses already boasting of record profits, would rather have actual blood on their hands, because people will die from this.",Strap in for a long pointless rant folks,2022-04-20 21:32:01
163,"Hi all, 

Using a throwaway for privacy reasons.

After living in the U.S. for 20 odd years, I've decided I'm moving back to Scotland, hopefully within the next two!

Things my American wife and I cannae fucking wait for:

- Being closer to our families (haven't seen ours in 5+ years)
- Being farther away from gun world
- (what’s left of) The NHS
- The hills and shit
- Having more space
- Chippies every day
- More rain
- Watching my team getting shafted in person instead of at 4am on a Sunday and catching it on a shite Hesgoal stream (mostly me looking forward to this)
- Kickin oot the Tories


We’re looking for some input from people currently living there (outside of our family) to get a better pulse on the state of things, and had a few questions.

1. With my wife moving as the spouse of a British citizen, can it really only take 10 weeks from filing the application to receiving a decision? Maybe I'm jaded by my immigration process to the U.S. but the process of her settling in the U.K. seems suspiciously simple from the .gov pages I've read through. If so, in theory she could arrive on a visitor visa, apply for residency whilst in the U.K on that visa, and receive an answer before the visitor visa expires...? (If only she was a Russian oligarch and could just purchase her citizenship)

2. How's the job market? We currently make $120k per year combined, and both expect to take a pay cut if we have to switch careers/start from the bottom somewhere, but is the market healthy or is it a 2000-people-applying-for-1-position kind of deal at the moment?

3. How’s the real estate and rental market? I recently read Edinburgh's median house price rose above 300k for the first time. Is this a nationwide trend?

4. Inflation is obviously going nuts at the moment, but how does the cost of living impact your actual take home pay when it’s not through the roof? The average salaries in my wife's field in Scotland seem to be around $10k-$15k lower than the U.S., so we'd like to budget as realistically as possible. Do the numbers on Numbeo seem accurate for Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow? 

5. Are there any good resources, both online or in-person, for helping immigrants assimilate?

6. Any shipping companies we could trust to send our sentimentalities and bigger belongings with? My wife sends packages to family in another European country and uses a shipping service specific to that country. It's considerably cheaper than any of the big three carriers over here (UPS, FedEx, DHL), but they don't service the U.K. and we'd love to find something similar.

I'll soon go back to higher education studying media/journalism, and I'm starting to deal with the fact that Scotland's politics are just bad for my mental health. I love Scotland, I have everything here and there are plenty of people abroad who would envy my position, but the social-political culture here is very toxic, and I don't know how much more I can take.

First of all, this year's election really hurt me mentally, the fact that the counting spanned two days didn't help, it was like ripping a painful bandage as slowly as possible. I also got angry at some political backpedalling, but that's not exclusive to Scotland so I'll ingore that. I kept checking BallotBoxScotland's Twitter, anxiously awaiting the results of each constituency, all the while going on with my day, every few minutes my body skipping a beat thinking ""oh my goodness at least one constituency has probably been called now"" and open up Twitter. In the end, I was happy with the results, I'm a filthy Antifa so seeing the SNP/Greens gain seats and the other parties either lose/not change their seats + seeing anti-parliament fascists fail to gain seats was nice, but that didn't end my stress. There was Kenmure, the SNP-Green deal, the fact that we might see IndyRef2 within the next 5 years and that the debate is going to be far from fucking civil, I don't look forward to that, as much as I want Scotland to yeet out of the UK.

I'm greatful for Nicola, there are not many places that have people like her as leaders, not to mention the Green confidence and supply is promising, I especially like Lorna Slater, but all this comes at a cost. We have a (failed) far-right movement that is somewhat loud (*cough* Dankula) and even the Tories are bending to it, having Douglas as a leader, the most far-right leader they've had and a proper crypto-fascist if you ask me, with his anti-ziganist comments and homophobic dogwhistling (not to mention his voting record) I'm so glad he lacks in charisma/mass appeal, or else that would suck royally.

There are decent unionists out there, not everyone is a BritNat, if you think the UK can still be reformed, cool, you do you, but we need to be honest; no-surrender Yoonery is toxic as-fuck and seeing what happened in America honestly scares me, because I can totally see orange-Dross voting fucks get violent and try something fucky, and before anyone calls me an alarmist, I predicted something similar to the Capitol Storming happening after Biden's election and I see the same brain-rot lunacy brewing over here, just look at Humza Yousaf and Anas Sarwar getting abuse because they're brown and Muslim, Humza tends to get more shit because he also happens to be pro-Indy on top of that, but Anas still has it bad. Right wingers are statistically more likely to turn to violence, whether they be Christian, Muslim or BritNats, and I'm worried about the latter.

But that's just electoral politics, socially it's not much better. I'm Nonbinary so, yeah, I think the ""TERF island"" comments are overblown, but I still feel a little uncomfortable, not to mention the homophobic attack in Edinburgh. *Homophobic*. This wasn't even a ""I support LGB but not the T"" this was old-fashioned queerphobia. I know that ""other places have it worse"" I am somewhat international, I even have a dual nationality being only half Scottish, but just because other people ""have it worse"" it doesn't discredit my/our situation.

On Leslie Riddoch's podcast she spoke about how young Scottish people she spoke to want IndyRef2 and if it doesn't happen or goes the wrong way ""they're off to New Zealand"" and that even pro-Indy people want to get on with their lives rather than be on ""semi-permanent standby mode"" and I really feel that. There is so much at stake here that it makes me sick. I've made a living here in Scotland but politically it's breaking me, the fact that David Paisley has decided to leave Scotland doesn't help my condition. I saw myself moving to say, Quebec or Belgium or Italy or whatever after University, but that would mean leaving everything behind... my friends, my rights, all of that, like emigrating would be a last resort like, if Scotland or more broadly, the UK go down the same way as the Weimar Republic... I can see that.

196,"Hey everyone! :) 

I'm looking at relocating from Bournemouth to Scotland in the autumn and am looking at living in and around the Glasgow area. I'm really excited to come up as it's been something I've wanted to do for about five years and I'm glad it's finally going to happen. It's mostly out of a desire for a change of scenery as I'm so sick of Bournemouth after being there for eight years and also a desire for a lower cost of living, I currently pay £630 a month for a small studio flat and I'm going to be stuck in such flats forever if I stick in Bournemouth.   

I can take my main job with me as it's become a working from home post as an immediate consequence of the pandemic; however, I've been working for an LGBT youth charity in Dorset first on a voluntary basis and currently on a paid basis for the past two years. I'm essentially the youth worker in charge of one of our groups, facilitating a weekly group of primarily 11-16 year olds and providing one-to-one support and specialised support for LGBT + related issues. I've also worked directly with families and older young people too, up to the age of 25. 

I'm aware of LGBT Youth Scotland and I did apply for a role with them back in February but wasn't shortlisted for interview but I'm not looking to work only with LGBT charities, I'm happy to work with young people in a variety of settings. 

I have a few questions relating to the above: 

1) What's the youth service provision like in Scotland? In England it was pretty much the first victim of austerity and a lot of it has been moved into the charity/voluntary sector. I've heard rumblings of a more functional youth service in Scotland but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate or not. 

2) Will not having a degree in youth work be an issue? I'm Level 3 qualified (NOCN Certificate of Youth Work Practice) but my degree is in English, not in Youth Work or anything related to it as I got into it quite a bit after I graduated. I am already on a JNC pay scale in my current job, though. 

3) Following on from the above, is there a postgraduate course I could study in Scotland that would make it so I held a degree? I'm in no position to go back to university as an undergraduate, even part time due to the fees associated with a second degree. 

4) What kind of youth organisations are there in Glasgow? Even though I've been doing some paid work in it, I'm happy to start off as a volunteer again if I have to go down that route. 

5) Does full time youth work/working with young people exist in Scotland? I realise I may be clutching straws with this one...",Youth Work Opportunities in Scotland,2021-06-23 18:14:44

Was doing a bit of reading last night to try to have some fact based arguments to respond to some of the bile that keeps getting repeated about post independence and wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction. I saw NS on Andrew Marr yesterday and she mentioned that the plan is to use the pound for several years which, I'm not sure is a great plan. 

As far as I can tell, back in 2016 it was calculated that for us to take on our share of the UK's debt would have cost us 109bn, obv that will have risen since so what I want to know before voting:

1. What is the total value of UK assets and what the four nations would be looking for as a split. I don't believe the Westminster gov will negotiate in good faith so would prefer to find another way to calculate that
2. What's the plan to protect pensions/house prices/wages/cost of living
3. How do we pay for that that clean break option if that's the route we go down which is, I believe, the SNPs preferred method rather than walking away

b) University of Stirling  (Stirling )

I am basically on a tight budget and difference between INR/Pounds in insane!!! I am heavily relying towards scholarships at the moment:

1)Stirling's program is offering a good scholarship. However, I am not sure of the work/part time opportunities in Stirling (as it's a small town) + the prestige isn't that high. Job prospects after graduation? Not sure!

2)University of Glasgow's program is very academically/theoretically aligned (although I need practical exposure in my field. They seem more into academia) but the prestige is high overall and Glasgow is amazing city to be in. The fees is every high and scholarship opportunities are almost ZERO for me. So again I am very confused!

3) RGU is a decent University, offered a course of my choice, focuses on employment after graduation and fees/scholarship opportunities are also good. However, again not sure of living in Aberdeen. Heard it's a pretty expensive city and a bit boring to be in?

200,"Hi everyone, I hope thisnis the right place to put this and hope this is allowed.

My partner and I, with our 1 year old are considering relocating to Scotland (from York) within the next couple of years. This is mainly due to a frustration and exasperation with English politics (ie Tories and their voters). 

We've both spent a lot of time in Scotland, have family in places and love everything about it.

We've narrowed our preffered areas to three, based on lifestyle, cost of living, job opportunities, education for our son and proximity to nature (I realise that all of Scotland is close to amazing nature). 

The three places are South Side Glasgow, Inverness and Dundee.

I was wondering if any one lives in these areas and could let us know more about the pros and cons of these areas? We've visited all three but obviously visiting a place and living there are completely different experiences so any help would be much appreciated.

N.B. Due to our careers location for job prospects isn't overly important and for myself would get better in Tourist areas. So any other places that you would like to recommend would also be greatly appreciated.

Cheers in advance",Where to move to in Scotland?,2021-02-22 21:51:26
201,"""I’m still reeling from the new regulations revealed by the UK Government just over 2 weeks ago regarding touring in the European Union post Brexit. I’ve been trying to make sense of it
all from all the sometimes contradictory and often vague information available on various websites that are constantly being updated and working out how this affects my own business and career. It’s quite frankly confounding.

I’ve grown tired of hearing “So what did musicians do before we joined the EU then?”.

In 1973 when the UK joined the EU I was 15 years old and the Global Music Industry revenues were around 5 billion US dollars. By the turn of the century they were around $25 billion and today worth around $21 billion with the UK music industry generating $7.5 billion. That is a figure that doesn’t even take in the vast independent network or all the ancillary workers and bolt on industries that contribute hugely these days to the International music business.

As an example, my album sales don’t even count as I’m not officially chart ‘registered’ and on unofficial figures I had a Top 10 album in the UK with over 10 000 physical mail order sales of my 11 th solo album, ‘Weltschmerz’ in the first week of release in October 2020. A purely independent release. A tree in the forest. And there are a lot of trees out there.

It’s a huge industry generating nearly 4 times more than the UK fishing industry which despite a loud lobbying voice has its own valid frustrations at this time as we deal with all this weight of bureaucracy now foisted upon us by Brexit.

To put things a bit in perspective ‘The Who’ between 1963 and 1973 played only around 55 shows in the current EU countries. I have 27 EU shows and 5 in Scandinavia rescheduled from last year going out across 43 days in the Autumn of this year. That is more than half of the 90 out of 180 days I am allowed to be in the EU under the new rules. If these shows had gone ahead as planned in 2020 I would have been booking further shows in the early part of this year, if the new regulations allowed. Taking into account any
EU festivals which are normally a 3-day venture across a performance, plus any promotion trips which would also have to be added to my tally, as well as personal visits to my German
family, and those 90 days in 180 fast disappear.

The visa/ permit situation has a major impact. From what I’ve discovered so far we now need permits for every country in the EU. In Holland for example the administration/ processing costs of a permit are around £250 per person not including the instigation and set up on our end. I carry a 10-person team; 6 musicians including myself, a back-line tech, a sound engineer, a lighting/projection tech and a production manager.

If the permits are for every individual country and of similar amounts then I have around £2500 in extra costs on permits alone for every EU country we perform in. This will rule out single shows in countries such as France and Belgium where I play medium club size gigs and put a lot of pressure on future shows in Spain and Italy where I normally have a brace of gigs of around 5-800 capacity. These shows are already squeaky as we work to minimum
guarantees that cover only costs from promoters and the visa/ permit charge represents nearly 50% of those guarantees. Some shows will quite simply become financially unfeasible
on potential permit costs alone.

Compared to many artists I operate with a very tight crew and I have to keep it lean to make the figures work and keep us on the road and earning a living for everyone concerned. I have learned to manage myself - thus saving 20% of my gross income, which can be used to finance touring - and have ‘assassinated’ as many middle men as possible to enable me to continue making music and perform shows. It’s a lot of work for someone who just wants
to be an artist but if I don’t take on these responsibilities myself I couldn’t make a living. And I am an established artist! I’ve just been handed a live grenade with the pin pulled out.

My heart goes out to musicians starting out in small clubs and at the beginning of their careers who have to find that money in advance of tours. Artists signed to major labels have a better chance but for independents it’s a killer.

Crew members and session musicians have an added hit from the newly limited time allowed in the EU. Most techs and session musicians make a living by touring with a variety of artists throughout the year and they will now be unable, or find it very difficult, to juggle schedules to adhere to the new rules on travel. In short UK based touring personnel will be hamstrung and UK artists might have to consider taking on EU based crew and musicians to
get around the restrictions – thus depriving their long-standing UK crew of being able to make a living.

We now have to have our passports stamped at every border crossing in order to officially document the time we spend in various countries as per the visas/ permits. At those crossings we must get a carnet stamped. This is a UK generated document that identifies and lists every piece of equipment carried out of the UK from guitars and amps to strings, drums and sticks and skins, keyboards etc. It is used to show that we take the equipment out
and cross every border with the same manifest and return to the UK with exactly the same contents. The carnet basically shows that we haven’t exported anything for sale to another country and haven’t imported anything out with the manifest. It has to be stamped going in and out of every country and miss a stamp and you walk into a nightmare of bureaucracy and potential heavy fines. (I’ve had to fly someone to Switzerland with supporting legal documents to have a carnet stamped that was missed as there was no one available at that time in the morning at the border as we were gig bound on a tight schedule)

At the border crossings the customs officers are totally within their rights to ask for an entire truck or trailer to be unloaded and examined to see if it matches the carnet documents. Protests on time constraints are a waste of energy and the tour-bus drivers just have to wait while the digital tachographs count down their drive time available. And the drivers’ operating and rest time in these potential circumstances has to be taken into consideration.
Being stopped for a couple of hours during the night at a border check could take a driver out of the legal time allowed at the wheel. In order to make sure we get to places we are supposed to be, the only solution now is to take on double drivers, who would normally only come on board for long hauls such as in Scandinavia or occasional big drives. Having 2 drivers full time on an entire tour just keeps on adding to the costs with not only their wages but hotel rooms and catering. The risks of losing shows because a driver is out of hours aren’t worth taking.

Yes, carnets existed before Brexit but they were only needed up till now in Switzerland and Norway. It’s now across every European country and every border crossing where they will
have to be stamped for the first time since 1973; 48 years ago, when amplifiers only had valves and ‘digital’ was a word in Science Fiction books. Legal drive time didn’t exist in 1973.

We pay tax in all the countries we play in Europe. For example in Germany it’s about 19% on the gross fee received from the promoter and unless you are represented by a German
based company who can reclaim some costs such as tour buses at around £1400 a day, hotels for any day off at over £1200 a night for the team, and various other production costs which include a contribution to crew wages, the tax is taken from the top.
When you pay those taxes you receive a credit note from the respective tax authority and that is provided to HMRC to put against your UK taxes. It’s called a reciprocal tax
agreement. I paid over £25k in withholding tax in the EU in 2018 on one tour after allowances for costs because I had a German agent.
Up till now I have not had an answer as to whether that still applies. Do we still get that allowance or will only a percentage of it apply if at all? At the moment my tax advisors don’t know. I’m supposed to be on tour in 8 months and don’t even know if it’s actually financially feasible. The contracts were signed in late 2019 and don’t take into consideration any post Brexit financial implications as no one knew what they were until 2 weeks ago.

We will now have to deal with the respective ‘national insurances’ in every country on top of the income tax. That applies to everyone in the band and crew and requires more paperwork and applications.

We will now also have to register for VAT in every EU country if we want to sell merchandise on the road and claim back VAT from costs. All taxes have to be paid in full before any merch leaves the UK and declarations could have to be made at every national border. If we are not registered then it’s near impossible to reclaim back the respective national VAT. As an example the German nightliner tour bus on the next alleged tour has around £13 000
VAT we now become liable for. This means more accountancy bills, more middlemen, more bureaucracy.

Like most other artists, I need merchandise sales on tour to supplement my income and allow us to play shows in areas where the promoter’s guarantee from ticket sales falls short of the costs required to perform there. As an independent artist a large amount of my album sales are on the road at the merchandise stall. Streaming changed the ball game and as a result, physical album sales in traditional record stores have collapsed compared to when I started in the music business 40 years ago, so playing live has become the principal source of income for many musicians
and bands. This comes through gig fees and direct-to-customer album and merchandise sales.

And I am a recognised artist with a loyal fanbase and playing decent size venues. I’ve managed through trial and error over time to find a model that works. I’m not in a new band making its first forays into Europe taking the big jump and betting on a chance to break into what is still the third biggest music market in the World, just a few miles on a ferry across the Channel. How are they supposed to find visa fees especially if they are an independent outfit? How do they front costs for that valuable merch that could be their only wages on a gig? The wages that pay their rent and the rehearsal rooms and fuel in the tank? How does the next young Iron Maiden, Simple Minds, The Cure or dare I say Marillion break
into the EU market now? From where is the UK government going to replace those potential future tax revenues from successful bands? Do they care? It certainly doesn’t appear so,
especially for the non-corporate bands.

These are just some of the razor wire hurdles I’ve come across so far since the new Brexit rules were published just a couple of weeks ago. Prior to that I’ve been discussing probabilities with fellow professionals, tour and production managers, accountants, and
advisors for well over 18 months trying to discover how this was all going to affect us – but the government left it so late, none of us have been able to prepare. Tours are booked over a year in advance and there is a lot of detailed planning involved. I’m used to that. And still no one seems to be any clearer on what is happening.

Some have accused the live music industry of not facing reality after the Brexit vote was determined by the accumulative vote across the UK. That is most definitely not true. We have been trying to read the runes and the smoke for a very long time and being in an industry that has to continually adjust to outside factors on a sometimes-daily basis while on the road we are accustomed to extraneous demands. Taking a double-barrelled shotgun to
our feet was not anywhere in the equation.

I’m not an accountant, never wanted to be. I wanted to be a creative artist and performer who could ply my trade and earn a living across borders, and especially in Europe, our closest neighbours and as I said the third biggest music market in the world next to the USA and Japan. It appears that the only sector benefitting from all these new regulations are accountants and advisors, and all those costs will percolate through to album and concert ticket prices.

And all of this during a pandemic that has crippled the music industry and put thousands out of work for an indefinite time.
I always look for silver linings with regards to my own situation and the only thing I can grasp on to is that my own postponed tour gives me preparation time to take on these seemingly constantly changing regulations and find a way forward. Some may say visa/permit costs, tax changes etc are negligible and part of the ‘cost’ of this current mess. For an arena level band, that may be so. It’s mostly an accountancy issue and they will usually have a wider
organisation who can focus on paperwork, but for others at my level and below it’s the difference between having a tour and a career in the music business or not.

And now? Where am I?

A 32 date European and Scandinavian tour looming in September with rehearsals necessary in August; an increasingly raging virus, nationwide vaccinations still a long way off, no
insurance for anything Covid related, promoters suggesting renegotiations of contracts for potential social distancing (impossible and refused), vastly increased merchandise
commission of around 20% of the gross sales (plus VAT) expected as venues and corporate entities involved try to recover losses and all of the above previously mentioned.

Is it going to happen? I wouldn’t buy tickets and incur fees that are non-returnable until I knew for certain the tour was happening. I certainly can’t hold up my hand and say I will be on tour in September or at any point this year.

And now, take another step back on this and look from the other side. I am on tour, potentially unvaccinated. Our tour merchandiser faces the public every night. She contracts the virus and we have maybe 10 days before she shows symptoms, and we are all together on a bus every day. Meanwhile in 10 days we could be in 7 cities intermingling with house crews, journalists, promoters, members of the general public etc. One band, one bus - one
potential travelling super-spreading Covid generator.

The tour is scheduled to start in just over 8 months, and we are still in lockdown here for perhaps another month and beyond. We should be looking at applying for visas/ permits by the beginning of summer latest to ensure we are regulatory compliable? And that means I will need to pay out £15k for work permits/visas we might not even need and in my opinion shouldn’t even be required in the first place?

The ‘bandwagon’ was already stalled by the pandemic and now bureaucracy has slashed the tyres and thrown sand in the engine while laying a minefield on the road with no maps to trust.

All the info I’ve related comes from current valid and credible sources. It’s not ‘fake news’ or ‘Remainer bullshit’. This is what I have discovered so far and what is being revealed on a day-to-day basis - on government and official websites which are constantly updated - still remains vague and doesn’t address specific questions we genuinely need answers to. It’s all real and at the moment it’s all that we know now.

I genuinely despair at the current state of the music industry and the dreams that are being broken on these rocks. I’m 63 this year and immensely grateful for what the music industry and the fans of my music have given me over the last 40 years. I just can’t imagine what it’s like for a young artist in these present times. I planned to retire from live music in 2023 and have just lost 2 years on a road I seriously don’t know if I will ever revisit.

We, the music business, and industry of the UK are currently in a perilous state. After all we have given to the world over the last 50 years and more; the revenue and cultural recognition that has been provided to this country through the musicians and technicians
and every ancillary member of the live music communities with their writing, creations, and performances. We deserve better than this from our elected government. We need a rethink,
and we need it sooner rather than later as our future is in jeopardy

The boy is really enjoying school. The new one that came along is loving nursery. We have a great group of friends and the mountain biking scene in Dorking is amazing. Dorking itself is a great wee town too. But nothing could prepare me for just how busy the SE is! Thankfully the biking in the Surrey Hills is amazing and we don’t need to drive anywhere but my god it’s a mission if you actually want to have a wee daytrip over 20 miles away. 

The biggest cultural shock for me as a lover of most outdoor pursuits is the absence of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Id never heard of a ‘bridleway’ until 4 years ago and never considered that you can’t ride a bike on a ‘footpath’. I got shouted at recently for riding with the kids on a footpath. What?! You mean  I can’t ride on this path that is wide enough and smooth enough to drive a bus down?! Madness! This also affects the other stuff I’d taken for granted - wild swimming, canoeing, wild camping etc. This will never change in this archaic Tory-loving country. 

So between that and doing a few more hours work most nights to pay for this ludicrous cost of living you’ll get an idea of how stifled I’m starting to feel. We’re starting to consider moving to the Glasgow area, possibly East Dumbartonshire mostly for the easy access to the hills for biking (and everything else I’m allowed to do!) and back towards family in Perth and Dundee. I’m actually starting to get quite excited about it! I’ve always really liked Glasgow and kind of wished I’d bypassed this whole thing and just moved that direction 4 years ago. But, ‘experiences’ etc.

The one problem is I have no idea how to even begin moving the boy out of/into school mid-term! He’s in Year 2 (Primary 3 in real money). It just seems like a chicken-egg-chicken situation. Anyone that has done the combined house-job-school move have any tips on where to begin?

214,"By Lesley Riddoch 

As the dust settles on the arrest, tent, police raid, and tabloid search for a glimpse of Nicola Sturgeon or Peter Murrell, the Easter break has given everyone a chance to look around a bit.

For independence supporters the situation may look bleak, as even the SNP’s interim CEO Mike Russell says; “I don’t think independence can be secured right now; we need to work towards some co-ordinated campaigning” with a “new Yes movement.”

Independence is the life blood of the SNP, the reason members join and campaigners chap doors and distribute leaflets each election time. So, does that admission mean the SNP is terminally damaged? No – or at least not yet.

Support for independence is remarkably steady and a new, joint, concerted campaign might just appeal to Yessers, so long as it’s 100% genuine and speedily delivered. But more importantly, the SNP is still the only game in town for Scots who’ve given up on Westminster. And that’s a lot of people. Besides it isn’t the only party with problems.

Saturday’s Tory-supporting Telegraph proclaimed “Tory fury as Douglas Ross says Scots should vote Labour to oust SNP” – a position party chairman Craig Hoy MSP implausibly denied his boss had actually taken on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show.

Analysts predict the Tories are set for a drubbing in the English local elections and another Tory MP has been caught trying to sell his wares in a Times sting.

The Daily Mail columnist Richard “no friend to the Nats” Littlejohn has suggested 20 cops arriving for a dawn raid at the Sturgeon/Murrell home was over the top. Meanwhile, talk of a leadership re-run or a sub-party forming at Holyrood should be tempered by the fact of Kate Forbes’ daily tweets supporting Humza Yousaf. She may be playing a waiting game but internal opposition will find it hard to coalesce around an alternative leader who doesn’t challenge the newly elected incumbent.

Still, the SNP and Scottish Government face massive challenges – there’s no escaping the fact. It’s just that switching support to (probably) Labour means accepting a British state that shows no signs of being able to confront or reform itself. Au contraire.

You don’t need to be a card-carrying Republican to feel slightly nauseous as faux Coronation excitement ramps up daily. It seems we should suspend criticism of the million-pound event since community activists will replace z-list dignitaries at the event. Huzzah. We should be chuffed that in a cost-of-living crisis, King Charles has designed a “scaled down” event with just one new gold carriage and two new thrones which will last 90 minutes not the three hours spent on Queen Elizabeth’s ceremony in 1953.

Still, while the British and international press trills about the chance for a moment of coronation togetherness, Scotland stands with one eyebrow collectively arched.

Shetland is still the only council to vote against a bank holiday for staff on the May coronation weekend – happily, national holidays in Scotland are determined by councils. But in Westminster-run Northern Ireland, local elections have been postponed by two weeks to avoid a clash. Yip, a month after celebrations of the democratic breakthrough achieved by the Good Friday Agreement 25 years ago, local democracy must take second place to the coronation of an unelected head of state.

And bizarrely that’s quite unremarkable in an archaic British state half of Scotland would leave but most of Scotland would reform. A Panelbase poll in December 2022 found 55% of Scots would prefer an independent Scotland to be a republic rather than headed by King Charles – a result which aligns Scotland with Europe where 21 of 27 EU member states are republics with elected heads of state.

Even amongst the six European monarchies, Britain is an outlier – the only country still conducting an actual coronation ceremony. European monarchies have either replaced them with simpler events (like Denmark) or never practised coronations (like the Netherlands and Belgium). Indeed, most monarchies today just require a simple oath taken in the country’s legislature. But hey Britain – simple? That’s not what monarchy is about.

Rory Scothorne suggests the British royal family is not just regal eye-candy but “indicates to subjects that Britain is not like other states, and thus need not be held to similar standards. By proving we do things differently here, [the monarchy] helps us avoid the realisation that we actually do things worse. It is royalty, above all, that makes Britain’s conservative constitution popular.” Maybe, in England but not with Scots.

One month before C-Day, Scots have far fewer street parties planned than the rest of the UK – though of course, spontaneity might yet kick in. Still, last year only 14 events were held in Scotland to celebrate 70 years of the Queen on the throne. Across the UK, there were 16,000. When it comes to the cowed reverence and Union Jack emblazoned excitement that accompanies royalty, Scots tend to back the Bard: “The rank is but the guinea’s stamp, The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.”

The Panelbase poll did find 45% of Scots would keep the monarchy in an independent country, but I suspect they’d expect a seriously pared-down European-style monarchy – which clearly ain’t what “frugal” Charles is planning. This is just one part of the obsequious, foreluck-tugging reality Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party must tackle or meekly endorse. Which will it be?

We already know the answer. Ditto with all the other big issues. What chance a return to full-blooded public ownership beyond railways that are already halfway there, and the bantamweight arrival of Great British Energy to compete on the sidelines while the billion pound profit-making BP and Shell rock on? None.

What chance of a return to the EU or at least the single market? None

What chance of an end to the ramped up anti-immigrant rhetoric that fuelled the recent attack on an asylum seeking hotel? Some, but the virility test for the Labour leader will be keeping the horrific Rwanda deportation route open and stopping more boats on the Channel.

Indeed, what chance vigorous, open debate on these and other vital issues while an unofficial policy of “wheesht for a Labour Government” is operating? Monica Lennon MSP admitted as much last week as she joined the chorus of criticism over Labour’s attack ads, signed off by Keir Starmer, which claim Rishi Sunak doesn’t think child sex abusers should go to prison. Until now wheeshting was only for indy. Actually, everyone does it.

Scotland is waiting to see what arises from Peter Murrell’s arrest. Clearly, Humza has it all to do. But so does everyone else who would unseat him.",Troubled SNP is the only game in town for Yes supporters,2023-04-10 11:08:37

228,"No tenant in their right mind would do this, obviously, but the situation below happened to a friend and I don’t thing it’s legal.

They recently had a conversation with their landlord, in which the landlord informally informed them that the buy to let mortgage doubled in the last 12 months and they would have to evict my friend and sell the property in the near future because they cannot increase the rent and they are losing money. The mortgage is now almost double the rent my friend is paying.

But oh, the landlord had a “convenient little solution” and that’s where it goes wrong. If the tenant (no pressure) voluntarily made an offer to pay a slightly higher rent then that would save some time and that way the tenant can keep living there for longer. 

Like if the my friend turned around and said “oh you poor landlord, I know you’re struggling, I am too. So I want to pay you more, I don’t care about myself, I care about you”. It is obvious that no tenant would do this without being forced into it. Which defeats the purpose of the rent freeze if there is this big red flag of a loophole. Landlords can easily say “voluntarily offer us a higher rent or out you go. But do it voluntarily, it’s your idea not mine”. If they refuse then evict them, put the property on the market for a month to look like you want to sell, then “oh, changed my mind” and rent it at a higher price.

My friend is faced with 2 options now: agree to this solution and do as told regardless of the legality of things. Or await an eviction notice and find an other place, which will cost more because of other buy to let landlords doing something similar and putting properties on the market way above a living rent.

Posting this mostly to give everyone in Scotland a new years laugh. Some fun parts

&gt;Even at Westminster Brexit is a topic politicians prefer to avoid. The ruling Conservatives tend to skirt it because leaving the EU has clearly not delivered the benefits they foresaw. Keir Starmer and his shadow cabinet treat Brexit as the Great Unmentionable for fear of alienating the Leave-voting Red Wall seats that Labour needs to win the next election.

My heart goes out to the English politicians ruining the UK because they're too scared to be honest under the FPTP system Labour and the Tories force on us like a cartel so they can cycle between themselves.

Speaking of the 'Great Unmentionable', I am once again asking for a single Scottish journalist to ask Sarwar why Scottish Labour are now a Brexit party?

&gt;It is true that the opinion polls have shown support for Brexit diminishing as the cost-of-living crisis has deepened, but the headlines are misleading. That support has fallen not because millions of Leavers have suddenly decided they voted the wrong way, but because they think the government has failed to exploit Brexit – not least by curbing immigration. Hence Nigel Farage’s recent threat to re-enter the political fray: “I spent a quarter of a century fighting for us to get Brexit, but I simply couldn’t stand aside and do nothing if this act of betrayal continues.”

Oh no, apparently a portion of England will go full gammon again and take votes from the Tories and Labour to vote for Farage/racism... whatever will we do about that 😱 Best get Sir Keir Starmer out stating too many foreigners are in the NHS and Rachel Reeves declaring more deportations are needed.

&gt;Suppose leading Remainers were unequivocally to state the obvious – that we will not seek another referendum for at least a generation; that the EU would not let us rejoin right now even if we voted to (and certainly not on the terms we previously enjoyed); and that not all the Brexiteers’ nostrums are wrong-headed. Levelling up, for example, is a laudable aim, as is weaning British industry off its dependence on cheap imported labour. 

Ah yes, democracy must stop for a period of time because people aren't allowed to change their minds if they feel they were lied to. Wonder where we've heard that one before 🤔

What is it with Brits and throwing toys out the pram if people on this island might be up for changing their mind? Or new electorate members come of age and want to send their parents to the shadow realm for screwing up their futures? Boomer tier pish that democracy has to stop for periods of time.

&gt;I also believe, as we enter 2023, that the mass of the British people are exhausted by the battles of the past six years and yearn to move on.

TL;DR: Moving from Ireland (the North bit) to Scotland due to a lack of resources and hope for someone a bit different to others (in my case, trans).

For the most part, people in that thread were very nice. Although the move won't be for a few years as I'll be needing to recover financially and physically from a major operation, as well as re-training in a few qualifications I'm still looking into a future over there. Talked to my partner about it and she's happy enough to move over with me.

But I'm still in the research stage and I'm wondering about the better places to live, factoring in the following:

Cost of living.

Safety. This is a big one, given the topic of that previous thread. My current town is pretty safe, but that's really the only reason I'm living here. Going elsewhere (especially Belfast) leads to a lot of shite from others.

Job prospects. This goes for both of us. Currently she works in a bank and I work as a carer, but I'm looking to change that soon. If times got tough I could pick up care shifts on the side with an agency, as I do have the qualifications.

Access to community/support. In my case job prospects would factor in here, too as the ideal job I'm aiming for would be a counsellor specialising in LGBT+ based support. It was also the main topic of that previous thread. A lot of people pointed out potential resources to me but I'm wondering what area would still have the best access.

Access to public transportation. Neither of us drive, so this is a big one. She grew up in Dublin so never really needed a car, whereas I get a bit too anxious behind the wheel. Would consider going back and finishing my lessons if there was no other option, though.

255,"The supreme court ruling today was, I think, pretty much expected and basically means there'll be no IndyRef in 2023, unless Sunak somehow changes his mind.

I'm very sure the SNP were expecting this too, I don't know what specifically they will plan to do next, other than the de-facto referendum, but these are some suggestions I have.

Sturgeon said today, the next step would be to look for the next thing that gives Scotland a chance to have their say, which would be the 2024/5 General Election (unless something unprecedented happens like a snap Holyrood/Westminster Election, or idk a referendum for a referendum lol). That means there's 2 more years before anything can happen.

In that time, the Scottish Government must build up support for independence. 

Potentially very controversial, but its all very good to say Scotland is being ignored however the reality is that polling doesn't support the claim that a majority want Scottish independence. If support for independence was made consistently high as it had been during the 2020-21 period, a mandate for a referendum would be impossible for Westminster to ignore.

There's a few ways this can be achieved, but the biggest shifts in opinion, IMO, will come from:

- 1. A **detailed**, costed, economic prospectus for independence. This would be difficult to gauge, but it's what's needed. People want numbers and hard figures, not promises. And that prospectus, if done correctly, would probably show a tough initial period, but the SNP/ Yes campaign should own that with confidence, show that they know the challenges and perhaps show what they will do to offset it as much as they can. Honesty and humility will go a long way.

They have 2 years to make an incredibly detailed paper. 

- 2. Better governance than Westminster. May be a bit obvious, but the whole reason behind the 2020-21 increase in independence support was that it was perceived that Scotland was performing better than Westminster, and had better leadership is response to the pandemic. 

In this cost of living crisis, achieving the same will go a _long_ way. I know Holyrood is limited in its powers but it must do whatever it can. Giving nurses a good enough pay deal and avoiding NHS strikes, giving teachers a good enough pay deal, giving rail workers a good enough pay deal, showing that Scotland listens to key workers. The UK Health Secretary is refusing to even engage in any conversation with the nurses planning to strike, that clear divide in attitude should be made even more stark.

Breaking the deadlock is what is needed in the next step of the independence campaign.

Obviously many other things that SNP / Yes campaign will need to do, but those are Two of the biggest things that will shift opinion, IMO.

Now, I'm just some random guy on reddit, my opinion on what is needed doesn't matter to the independence campaign, but I believe this route is the only possible way to an independence referendum _and_ a Yes win.

Let me know if you disagree, or agree, what other suggestions you may have. Happy to have a discussion. :)",The next steps for an IndyRef,2022-11-23 16:47:15

&gt;  
The turmoil that sprang from Liz Truss’s mini-budget boosted faith in the economic case for Scottish independence, according to a poll.  
&gt;  
&gt;Voters were equally optimistic about their fortunes in the event of a break-up of the UK as they would be about remaining in the status quo, according to research for Ipsos. Its survey found 43 per cent of the population believed Scotland’s economy would be better off after independence, exactly the same proportion as those who favoured the prospects of the United Kingdom. Ten per cent said it would make no difference and 4 per cent were unsure.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Nicola Sturgeon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/nicola-sturgeon?page=1) has sought in recent months to capitalise on the chaos wrought by the [mini-budget](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mini-budget-panic-may-be-spreading-to-property-funds-vhfd96k35) of September 23, which included £45 billion of unfunded taxcuts and led to pandemonium in the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel survey, which was carried out last month during the dying days of Truss’s premiership, found that the public in Scotland and across the UK were increasingly gloomy about their economic prospects as the cost of living escalated.  
&gt;  
&gt;In all four nations, people were more likely to think the economies of the rest of the Union would be worse off — (37 per cent) than better off (20 per cent) [if Scotland became independent](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/scottish-independence?page=1), according to the research. It found that a higher proportion, 45 per cent, of people in Scotland thought that the remaining UK economies would be worse off in the event of secession.  
Emily Gray, the managing director of Ipsos Scotland, said: “With the [cost of living crisis](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/welcome-to-the-new-normal-0dvkwdrkg) deepening, most people expect gloomy economic times ahead and the measures that governments at both Holyrood and Westminster set out over the coming months to help weather the crises may well shift public views on Scotland’s economic future further.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The economic uncertainty of starting a new country — particularly around [Scotland’s notional deficit](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/so-all-we-need-now-is-the-luck-of-flashman-9505x0mqk), the fiscal transfer from the UK government and trade — has been one of the key arguments made for the Union.  
&gt;  
&gt;Previous polls had suggested that even the plunging value of the pound and a Bank of England bailout for pensions in the wake of Truss unveiling her economic plans had done little to shift the dial around independence up until this point.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Rishi Sunak ](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/rishi-sunak?page=1)will hope that the [autumn statement](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/autumn-statement-2022-jeremy-hunt-tax-rishi-sunak-latest-news-9d8gbsl0p), to be delivered tomorrow, will present a more stable vision for the UK’s economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a referendum next October but is awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court on whether Holyrood has the power to call a vote without Westminster’s agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;The first minister has published three papers setting out her prospectus for a new country and has made much of the UK’s economic turmoil in an effort to entice people towards independence. Writing in the Financial Times yesterday she said that an “inherently weak and unstable economic model seems now to be hardwired into the UK’s future”.  
&gt;  
&gt;She added: “One thing is already clear — to build a more prosperous and fairer future, Scottish independence is not only desirable, it is now essential.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Confidence in the UK’s economy dropped among the Scottish public with 80 per cent expecting the general economic condition of the UK to worsen in the next 12 months, compared with 73 per cent in February.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to Scotland’s economic prospects, the public are also pessimistic with 73 per cent expecting Scotland’s general economic condition to deteriorate over the year ahead, compared with 68 per cent earlier this year.

Unpopular opinion time. 

I am getting fed up with all these people striking in the public sector. Yes it sucks that cost of living is through the roof but you are now begining to harm everyone, which I know is the point of the strike until you get your way. 

Plenty of people out there getting no pay rises or certainly not anywhere near 5%. 

There comes a point where enough is enough. 

And the line has to me made at ScotRail for me. 

Do I think that extra money should be found for the NHS pay rises? Of course. 

But the train system is failing due to its unreliability and cost. It failed as a private business and has gone nationalised. If it was still privately owned, there would be job losses and cut backs.  

This strike will have an impact on every business in the cities as Christmas trade suffers. It will have an impact on people's mental health as they can unwind from their jobs at weekends, such as supporting the national team at Murray field or getting to the pub. 

It's completely selfish and I really hope that the government hold fast and make an example of them.

264,"&gt;The government is thought to be considering raising pensions and benefits in line with wage growth of 5.5%, saving about £8bn next year for the exchequer, after Hunt said decisions of “eye-watering difficulty” were needed to balance the books after the failed mini-budget.
&gt;
&gt;The Resolution Foundation said such a switch would have stark consequences for families struggling with soaring living costs. A single disabled adult on universal credit would lose £380, while a working single parent with one child would lose £478, and a working couple with three children would lose £978.
&gt;
&gt;Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the thinktank, said: “While the significant Treasury savings may look tempting in the context of its attempts to fill its fiscal hole, the cost to 10 million working-age families and almost every pensioner would be huge.”

So yet again the poor and needy must pay because the rich elites have once again fucked the economy, country and don't want to be responsible for it.

Owing to a strike by refuse workers, mounds of rubbish bags lay piled up on the streets; noxious slime oozed onto pavements from overflowing public bins; and a foul stench hung heavy in the air.**

Initially, the SNP Government tried to pin the blame on Edinburgh’s Labour-run council, but that strategy unravelled when workers in a string of other local authorities walked out too. Nor is there yet an end in sight. This week, unions rejected an offer of a 5% pay rise, plus a one-off payment for lower earners, saying it would do too little to help the half of Scottish council workers who are paid less than £25,000pa. Scotland is in the midst of a summer of discontent, next week, schools and nurseries will close for three days as a result of strikes by cleaners and other support staff. And though Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP administration has now offered extra funding to help settle the disputes, critics blame it for slashing local authority budgets in the first place, leaving them ill-prepared for the cost-of-living crisis. This is yet another setback, to add to the long list the SNP has presided over. It suits Sturgeon to blame Westminster; but the country’s real problem is that it is governed by people who’ve no real interest in the day-to-day grind of government. They haven’t joined the SNP to raise school standards, or cut NHS waiting lists. They have only one real goal: the creation of an independent Scotland.

You might expect the escalating strikes to pose a threat to Sturgeon’s grip on power, But the divisive issue of independence remains very potent in Scotland, and while that debate rages, other matters “tend to take a backseat”.

Fast forward to 2020 and I managed to land my first programming job at an absolute dump at the height of covid in a storage container (A story for another time). That job got me on the ladder to where I am now so I'm not so mad anymore. 

Now I'm on £27k and I work from home, which is amazing for both my sanity and fuel.

**General cost of living:** We shop at Aldi and even there we are starting to notice it.

**Energy:** We will be coming to the end of our fixed rate soon after moving in.

**Mortgage:** If our house isn't built by the time our mortgage offer is valid until then we will need to reapply and will easily cost a few extra £100 a month. 

**All other money:** Just been saving it for the move.

Once we move all of our bills are set to rise, but we took that into account at the time and made sure that we wouldn't be on the breadline. Things have changed a bit since our original figures.

Everything is on the rise, and while we are in a relatively good position, I am worried about the future. We will have enough to get by month to month, and if we save for a few months we will maybe even be able to go on a holiday. 

But what if the washing machine breaks? What if the car needs repairing, what if our dog falls ill and the insurance doesn't cover it? What about my friends and family that are already on the breadline? What about my family that has already decided that they just won't pay energy bills this winter and face the backlash at another time? Why is anyone having to make these sorts of decisions?

I'm sick of seeing headlines and videos pop up that are just a pissing contest between politicians, or companies posting record profits. Or the bank of england raising their interest rates while putting out a statement that they know that some people are finding the cost of living tough.

343,"I know this is me preaching to the converted but I seriously need to vent, I am in Edinburgh and what Labour is doing here is something straight out of an Alba voter's conspiracy theory.

They are leaving the SNP-Labour coalition in favour of forming one with the LibDems and Tories, the latter part has majorly pissed off a lot of people, including Lab voters, because in this city, when we went to vote, we had stuff like spaces for people, schools, investment in the capital, the cost of living crisis, and superlandlords on our mind. What we Didn't have in mind, was whether or not the party WANTED TO FUCK A BUTCHER'S APRON AND HIDE THEIR ACCENTS IN FRONT OF THEIR OVERLORDS.

The SNP and Greens were open to a left-wing coalition with Labour, despite the independence disagreement. But no, no that cunt of a leader Cammy Day loves Boris Johnson's cock more than air, so he's planning a deal with the Tories, who may I remind/inform you, were the only party against spaces for people which they labelled as a ""war on cars"" meanwhile Labour were gesturing at continuing environmental initiatives. Also keep in mind that the Tories ended up dead last, losing half their seats, the Greens outperformed them, the city firmly said No to the Tories' message, and they are essentially being rewarded for losing and Lab is going against the wishes of even Their Own voters.

What the actual fuck are they thinking, they have the gall to say ""NaTs R oObSeSsEd WiTh InDepUnDanCE"" yet what I see here, is the yoon parties who are being obsessed. Independence has nothing, I repreat, NOTHING to do with local politics, fuck all, nada, rien, nichts, ni sam bith. So tell me, if Labour are supposedly so upset at the SNP and Nicky being ""obsessed with independence"" why are they making a choice that very much gestures at them being so obsessed with independence they're rather side with a right-wing party?

Fuck this fossil of a party, their supporters is just Orange boomers who remember the poll tax, middle-class Coldplay 90s libs and clueless hipsters who think wearing red makes you socialist automatically, and frankly I'm sick of foreigners on left-wing subs saying ""um acksually you need to vote Labour sweaty"" because they think this is the ""good-enough tactical-vote liberal party"" that it is in England. It is not, and this is proof. If Labour and the Toris chum up in England, it will be the start of the fucking Biblical Armageddon, here it's buisness as usual.

The one small silver lining in this shit storm is inflation is expected to fall to 2% after 2 long years. 

“There is more than one reason why the rate of inflation is so high now. 

It started to rise in 2021 and that was partly to do with the economy recovering from the Covid crisis. 

Economies around the world, including in the UK, opened up after Covid restrictions eased. And then people naturally wanted to start buying things again.

But businesses selling some of those things couldn’t get enough of them to their customers. This caused prices to rise - especially for goods coming from abroad.

Added to that, there was a very sharp rise in energy (oil and gas) prices. All of these things pushed prices (and the rate of inflation) up.

In early 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to more large increases in the price of things like energy and food. 

The lockdowns in China (due to Covid) are also making it harder to import some goods to the UK. So that is pushing up prices too. 

These two factors explain the large majority of the increase in inflation.”

357,"
I’ve just read a story about an 11 year old boy that asked if a plumber, already at his charitably, would like to buy his PlayStation so that his Mum and Dad could afford to eat with him.

I’m heart broken, the Tories are always banging on about the UK being the fastest growing economy in the G7 (proven lie), and being the world’s 5th largest economy- so how does it get like this?

How do we have 2.5 million people needing to use foodbanks?

A number set to grow even higher, experts at the Trussell trust think that nearly 1 in 10 parents are veru likely to use food banks within the next three months.
Almost 20% of parents in the last year have gone without food to make sure their child has enough to eat.

People are already reporting that they can no longer afford to use their oven’s because the cost of energy is extortionate.

And some food banks are asking people not to donate ropt vegetable and potatoes because people cannot afford the longer cooking times these need to undergo.

The government has totally outsourced its moral obligation to provide for the people they govern to the charity of those same people.

They needed to be shamed and publicly pressured to provide free school meals to children during Covid, and promptly outsourced that to a Tory donor who provided woefully inadequate amounts and qualities of food, and then pocketed the difference.

The UK might have one of the worlds largest economies but the vast majority of that wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people. The wealthiest 10% control 43% of the wealth, the wealthiest 1% controls almost 25% of all of the wealth of the UK.
Meanwhile the least well off 50% control only 9%.

This income inequality is growing, as the government strips more and more publicly owned services, selling them off to “preferred bidders”, classmates from university/ private schools/ companies they own shares in.

12 year of Tory Austerity, corruption, cronyism, law breaking, lying, and outright theft has left the country on the brink.

The cost of living crisis is getting worse, food prices, fuel prices, energy prices, are all set to rise, but wages are stagnant, and, rather than take a cut in profits the huge businesses already boasting of record profits, would rather have actual blood on their hands, because people will die from this.",Strap in for a long pointless rant folks,2022-04-20 21:32:01
365,"Hi all, 

Using a throwaway for privacy reasons.

After living in the U.S. for 20 odd years, I've decided I'm moving back to Scotland, hopefully within the next two!

Things my American wife and I cannae fucking wait for:

- Being closer to our families (haven't seen ours in 5+ years)
- Being farther away from gun world
- (what’s left of) The NHS
- The hills and shit
- Having more space
- Chippies every day
- More rain
- Watching my team getting shafted in person instead of at 4am on a Sunday and catching it on a shite Hesgoal stream (mostly me looking forward to this)
- Kickin oot the Tories


We’re looking for some input from people currently living there (outside of our family) to get a better pulse on the state of things, and had a few questions.

1. With my wife moving as the spouse of a British citizen, can it really only take 10 weeks from filing the application to receiving a decision? Maybe I'm jaded by my immigration process to the U.S. but the process of her settling in the U.K. seems suspiciously simple from the .gov pages I've read through. If so, in theory she could arrive on a visitor visa, apply for residency whilst in the U.K on that visa, and receive an answer before the visitor visa expires...? (If only she was a Russian oligarch and could just purchase her citizenship)

2. How's the job market? We currently make $120k per year combined, and both expect to take a pay cut if we have to switch careers/start from the bottom somewhere, but is the market healthy or is it a 2000-people-applying-for-1-position kind of deal at the moment?

3. How’s the real estate and rental market? I recently read Edinburgh's median house price rose above 300k for the first time. Is this a nationwide trend?

4. Inflation is obviously going nuts at the moment, but how does the cost of living impact your actual take home pay when it’s not through the roof? The average salaries in my wife's field in Scotland seem to be around $10k-$15k lower than the U.S., so we'd like to budget as realistically as possible. Do the numbers on Numbeo seem accurate for Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Glasgow? 

5. Are there any good resources, both online or in-person, for helping immigrants assimilate?

6. Any shipping companies we could trust to send our sentimentalities and bigger belongings with? My wife sends packages to family in another European country and uses a shipping service specific to that country. It's considerably cheaper than any of the big three carriers over here (UPS, FedEx, DHL), but they don't service the U.K. and we'd love to find something similar.

395,"I'm writing this as a sort of vent, but hopefully I can discuss this with other people.

I'll soon go back to higher education studying media/journalism, and I'm starting to deal with the fact that Scotland's politics are just bad for my mental health. I love Scotland, I have everything here and there are plenty of people abroad who would envy my position, but the social-political culture here is very toxic, and I don't know how much more I can take.

First of all, this year's election really hurt me mentally, the fact that the counting spanned two days didn't help, it was like ripping a painful bandage as slowly as possible. I also got angry at some political backpedalling, but that's not exclusive to Scotland so I'll ingore that. I kept checking BallotBoxScotland's Twitter, anxiously awaiting the results of each constituency, all the while going on with my day, every few minutes my body skipping a beat thinking ""oh my goodness at least one constituency has probably been called now"" and open up Twitter. In the end, I was happy with the results, I'm a filthy Antifa so seeing the SNP/Greens gain seats and the other parties either lose/not change their seats + seeing anti-parliament fascists fail to gain seats was nice, but that didn't end my stress. There was Kenmure, the SNP-Green deal, the fact that we might see IndyRef2 within the next 5 years and that the debate is going to be far from fucking civil, I don't look forward to that, as much as I want Scotland to yeet out of the UK.

I'm greatful for Nicola, there are not many places that have people like her as leaders, not to mention the Green confidence and supply is promising, I especially like Lorna Slater, but all this comes at a cost. We have a (failed) far-right movement that is somewhat loud (*cough* Dankula) and even the Tories are bending to it, having Douglas as a leader, the most far-right leader they've had and a proper crypto-fascist if you ask me, with his anti-ziganist comments and homophobic dogwhistling (not to mention his voting record) I'm so glad he lacks in charisma/mass appeal, or else that would suck royally.

There are decent unionists out there, not everyone is a BritNat, if you think the UK can still be reformed, cool, you do you, but we need to be honest; no-surrender Yoonery is toxic as-fuck and seeing what happened in America honestly scares me, because I can totally see orange-Dross voting fucks get violent and try something fucky, and before anyone calls me an alarmist, I predicted something similar to the Capitol Storming happening after Biden's election and I see the same brain-rot lunacy brewing over here, just look at Humza Yousaf and Anas Sarwar getting abuse because they're brown and Muslim, Humza tends to get more shit because he also happens to be pro-Indy on top of that, but Anas still has it bad. Right wingers are statistically more likely to turn to violence, whether they be Christian, Muslim or BritNats, and I'm worried about the latter.

But that's just electoral politics, socially it's not much better. I'm Nonbinary so, yeah, I think the ""TERF island"" comments are overblown, but I still feel a little uncomfortable, not to mention the homophobic attack in Edinburgh. *Homophobic*. This wasn't even a ""I support LGB but not the T"" this was old-fashioned queerphobia. I know that ""other places have it worse"" I am somewhat international, I even have a dual nationality being only half Scottish, but just because other people ""have it worse"" it doesn't discredit my/our situation.

On Leslie Riddoch's podcast she spoke about how young Scottish people she spoke to want IndyRef2 and if it doesn't happen or goes the wrong way ""they're off to New Zealand"" and that even pro-Indy people want to get on with their lives rather than be on ""semi-permanent standby mode"" and I really feel that. There is so much at stake here that it makes me sick. I've made a living here in Scotland but politically it's breaking me, the fact that David Paisley has decided to leave Scotland doesn't help my condition. I saw myself moving to say, Quebec or Belgium or Italy or whatever after University, but that would mean leaving everything behind... my friends, my rights, all of that, like emigrating would be a last resort like, if Scotland or more broadly, the UK go down the same way as the Weimar Republic... I can see that.

398,"Hey everyone! :) 

I'm looking at relocating from Bournemouth to Scotland in the autumn and am looking at living in and around the Glasgow area. I'm really excited to come up as it's been something I've wanted to do for about five years and I'm glad it's finally going to happen. It's mostly out of a desire for a change of scenery as I'm so sick of Bournemouth after being there for eight years and also a desire for a lower cost of living, I currently pay £630 a month for a small studio flat and I'm going to be stuck in such flats forever if I stick in Bournemouth.   

I can take my main job with me as it's become a working from home post as an immediate consequence of the pandemic; however, I've been working for an LGBT youth charity in Dorset first on a voluntary basis and currently on a paid basis for the past two years. I'm essentially the youth worker in charge of one of our groups, facilitating a weekly group of primarily 11-16 year olds and providing one-to-one support and specialised support for LGBT + related issues. I've also worked directly with families and older young people too, up to the age of 25. 

I'm aware of LGBT Youth Scotland and I did apply for a role with them back in February but wasn't shortlisted for interview but I'm not looking to work only with LGBT charities, I'm happy to work with young people in a variety of settings. 

I have a few questions relating to the above: 

1) What's the youth service provision like in Scotland? In England it was pretty much the first victim of austerity and a lot of it has been moved into the charity/voluntary sector. I've heard rumblings of a more functional youth service in Scotland but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate or not. 

2) Will not having a degree in youth work be an issue? I'm Level 3 qualified (NOCN Certificate of Youth Work Practice) but my degree is in English, not in Youth Work or anything related to it as I got into it quite a bit after I graduated. I am already on a JNC pay scale in my current job, though. 

3) Following on from the above, is there a postgraduate course I could study in Scotland that would make it so I held a degree? I'm in no position to go back to university as an undergraduate, even part time due to the fees associated with a second degree. 

4) What kind of youth organisations are there in Glasgow? Even though I've been doing some paid work in it, I'm happy to start off as a volunteer again if I have to go down that route. 

5) Does full time youth work/working with young people exist in Scotland? I realise I may be clutching straws with this one...",Youth Work Opportunities in Scotland,2021-06-23 18:14:44

Was doing a bit of reading last night to try to have some fact based arguments to respond to some of the bile that keeps getting repeated about post independence and wondering if anyone can point me in the right direction. I saw NS on Andrew Marr yesterday and she mentioned that the plan is to use the pound for several years which, I'm not sure is a great plan. 

As far as I can tell, back in 2016 it was calculated that for us to take on our share of the UK's debt would have cost us 109bn, obv that will have risen since so what I want to know before voting:

1. What is the total value of UK assets and what the four nations would be looking for as a split. I don't believe the Westminster gov will negotiate in good faith so would prefer to find another way to calculate that
2. What's the plan to protect pensions/house prices/wages/cost of living
3. How do we pay for that that clean break option if that's the route we go down which is, I believe, the SNPs preferred method rather than walking away

2)University of Glasgow's program is very academically/theoretically aligned (although I need practical exposure in my field. They seem more into academia) but the prestige is high overall and Glasgow is amazing city to be in. The fees is every high and scholarship opportunities are almost ZERO for me. So again I am very confused!

3) RGU is a decent University, offered a course of my choice, focuses on employment after graduation and fees/scholarship opportunities are also good. However, again not sure of living in Aberdeen. Heard it's a pretty expensive city and a bit boring to be in?

402,"Hi everyone, I hope thisnis the right place to put this and hope this is allowed.

My partner and I, with our 1 year old are considering relocating to Scotland (from York) within the next couple of years. This is mainly due to a frustration and exasperation with English politics (ie Tories and their voters). 

We've both spent a lot of time in Scotland, have family in places and love everything about it.

We've narrowed our preffered areas to three, based on lifestyle, cost of living, job opportunities, education for our son and proximity to nature (I realise that all of Scotland is close to amazing nature). 

The three places are South Side Glasgow, Inverness and Dundee.

I was wondering if any one lives in these areas and could let us know more about the pros and cons of these areas? We've visited all three but obviously visiting a place and living there are completely different experiences so any help would be much appreciated.

N.B. Due to our careers location for job prospects isn't overly important and for myself would get better in Tourist areas. So any other places that you would like to recommend would also be greatly appreciated.

Cheers in advance",Where to move to in Scotland?,2021-02-22 21:51:26
403,"""I’m still reeling from the new regulations revealed by the UK Government just over 2 weeks ago regarding touring in the European Union post Brexit. I’ve been trying to make sense of it
all from all the sometimes contradictory and often vague information available on various websites that are constantly being updated and working out how this affects my own business and career. It’s quite frankly confounding.

I’ve grown tired of hearing “So what did musicians do before we joined the EU then?”.

In 1973 when the UK joined the EU I was 15 years old and the Global Music Industry revenues were around 5 billion US dollars. By the turn of the century they were around $25 billion and today worth around $21 billion with the UK music industry generating $7.5 billion. That is a figure that doesn’t even take in the vast independent network or all the ancillary workers and bolt on industries that contribute hugely these days to the International music business.

As an example, my album sales don’t even count as I’m not officially chart ‘registered’ and on unofficial figures I had a Top 10 album in the UK with over 10 000 physical mail order sales of my 11 th solo album, ‘Weltschmerz’ in the first week of release in October 2020. A purely independent release. A tree in the forest. And there are a lot of trees out there.

It’s a huge industry generating nearly 4 times more than the UK fishing industry which despite a loud lobbying voice has its own valid frustrations at this time as we deal with all this weight of bureaucracy now foisted upon us by Brexit.

To put things a bit in perspective ‘The Who’ between 1963 and 1973 played only around 55 shows in the current EU countries. I have 27 EU shows and 5 in Scandinavia rescheduled from last year going out across 43 days in the Autumn of this year. That is more than half of the 90 out of 180 days I am allowed to be in the EU under the new rules. If these shows had gone ahead as planned in 2020 I would have been booking further shows in the early part of this year, if the new regulations allowed. Taking into account any
EU festivals which are normally a 3-day venture across a performance, plus any promotion trips which would also have to be added to my tally, as well as personal visits to my German
family, and those 90 days in 180 fast disappear.

The visa/ permit situation has a major impact. From what I’ve discovered so far we now need permits for every country in the EU. In Holland for example the administration/ processing costs of a permit are around £250 per person not including the instigation and set up on our end. I carry a 10-person team; 6 musicians including myself, a back-line tech, a sound engineer, a lighting/projection tech and a production manager.

If the permits are for every individual country and of similar amounts then I have around £2500 in extra costs on permits alone for every EU country we perform in. This will rule out single shows in countries such as France and Belgium where I play medium club size gigs and put a lot of pressure on future shows in Spain and Italy where I normally have a brace of gigs of around 5-800 capacity. These shows are already squeaky as we work to minimum
guarantees that cover only costs from promoters and the visa/ permit charge represents nearly 50% of those guarantees. Some shows will quite simply become financially unfeasible
on potential permit costs alone.

Compared to many artists I operate with a very tight crew and I have to keep it lean to make the figures work and keep us on the road and earning a living for everyone concerned. I have learned to manage myself - thus saving 20% of my gross income, which can be used to finance touring - and have ‘assassinated’ as many middle men as possible to enable me to continue making music and perform shows. It’s a lot of work for someone who just wants
to be an artist but if I don’t take on these responsibilities myself I couldn’t make a living. And I am an established artist! I’ve just been handed a live grenade with the pin pulled out.

My heart goes out to musicians starting out in small clubs and at the beginning of their careers who have to find that money in advance of tours. Artists signed to major labels have a better chance but for independents it’s a killer.

Crew members and session musicians have an added hit from the newly limited time allowed in the EU. Most techs and session musicians make a living by touring with a variety of artists throughout the year and they will now be unable, or find it very difficult, to juggle schedules to adhere to the new rules on travel. In short UK based touring personnel will be hamstrung and UK artists might have to consider taking on EU based crew and musicians to
get around the restrictions – thus depriving their long-standing UK crew of being able to make a living.

We now have to have our passports stamped at every border crossing in order to officially document the time we spend in various countries as per the visas/ permits. At those crossings we must get a carnet stamped. This is a UK generated document that identifies and lists every piece of equipment carried out of the UK from guitars and amps to strings, drums and sticks and skins, keyboards etc. It is used to show that we take the equipment out
and cross every border with the same manifest and return to the UK with exactly the same contents. The carnet basically shows that we haven’t exported anything for sale to another country and haven’t imported anything out with the manifest. It has to be stamped going in and out of every country and miss a stamp and you walk into a nightmare of bureaucracy and potential heavy fines. (I’ve had to fly someone to Switzerland with supporting legal documents to have a carnet stamped that was missed as there was no one available at that time in the morning at the border as we were gig bound on a tight schedule)

At the border crossings the customs officers are totally within their rights to ask for an entire truck or trailer to be unloaded and examined to see if it matches the carnet documents. Protests on time constraints are a waste of energy and the tour-bus drivers just have to wait while the digital tachographs count down their drive time available. And the drivers’ operating and rest time in these potential circumstances has to be taken into consideration.
Being stopped for a couple of hours during the night at a border check could take a driver out of the legal time allowed at the wheel. In order to make sure we get to places we are supposed to be, the only solution now is to take on double drivers, who would normally only come on board for long hauls such as in Scandinavia or occasional big drives. Having 2 drivers full time on an entire tour just keeps on adding to the costs with not only their wages but hotel rooms and catering. The risks of losing shows because a driver is out of hours aren’t worth taking.

Yes, carnets existed before Brexit but they were only needed up till now in Switzerland and Norway. It’s now across every European country and every border crossing where they will
have to be stamped for the first time since 1973; 48 years ago, when amplifiers only had valves and ‘digital’ was a word in Science Fiction books. Legal drive time didn’t exist in 1973.

We pay tax in all the countries we play in Europe. For example in Germany it’s about 19% on the gross fee received from the promoter and unless you are represented by a German
based company who can reclaim some costs such as tour buses at around £1400 a day, hotels for any day off at over £1200 a night for the team, and various other production costs which include a contribution to crew wages, the tax is taken from the top.
When you pay those taxes you receive a credit note from the respective tax authority and that is provided to HMRC to put against your UK taxes. It’s called a reciprocal tax
agreement. I paid over £25k in withholding tax in the EU in 2018 on one tour after allowances for costs because I had a German agent.
Up till now I have not had an answer as to whether that still applies. Do we still get that allowance or will only a percentage of it apply if at all? At the moment my tax advisors don’t know. I’m supposed to be on tour in 8 months and don’t even know if it’s actually financially feasible. The contracts were signed in late 2019 and don’t take into consideration any post Brexit financial implications as no one knew what they were until 2 weeks ago.

We will now have to deal with the respective ‘national insurances’ in every country on top of the income tax. That applies to everyone in the band and crew and requires more paperwork and applications.

We will now also have to register for VAT in every EU country if we want to sell merchandise on the road and claim back VAT from costs. All taxes have to be paid in full before any merch leaves the UK and declarations could have to be made at every national border. If we are not registered then it’s near impossible to reclaim back the respective national VAT. As an example the German nightliner tour bus on the next alleged tour has around £13 000
VAT we now become liable for. This means more accountancy bills, more middlemen, more bureaucracy.

Like most other artists, I need merchandise sales on tour to supplement my income and allow us to play shows in areas where the promoter’s guarantee from ticket sales falls short of the costs required to perform there. As an independent artist a large amount of my album sales are on the road at the merchandise stall. Streaming changed the ball game and as a result, physical album sales in traditional record stores have collapsed compared to when I started in the music business 40 years ago, so playing live has become the principal source of income for many musicians
and bands. This comes through gig fees and direct-to-customer album and merchandise sales.

And I am a recognised artist with a loyal fanbase and playing decent size venues. I’ve managed through trial and error over time to find a model that works. I’m not in a new band making its first forays into Europe taking the big jump and betting on a chance to break into what is still the third biggest music market in the World, just a few miles on a ferry across the Channel. How are they supposed to find visa fees especially if they are an independent outfit? How do they front costs for that valuable merch that could be their only wages on a gig? The wages that pay their rent and the rehearsal rooms and fuel in the tank? How does the next young Iron Maiden, Simple Minds, The Cure or dare I say Marillion break
into the EU market now? From where is the UK government going to replace those potential future tax revenues from successful bands? Do they care? It certainly doesn’t appear so,
especially for the non-corporate bands.

These are just some of the razor wire hurdles I’ve come across so far since the new Brexit rules were published just a couple of weeks ago. Prior to that I’ve been discussing probabilities with fellow professionals, tour and production managers, accountants, and
advisors for well over 18 months trying to discover how this was all going to affect us – but the government left it so late, none of us have been able to prepare. Tours are booked over a year in advance and there is a lot of detailed planning involved. I’m used to that. And still no one seems to be any clearer on what is happening.

Some have accused the live music industry of not facing reality after the Brexit vote was determined by the accumulative vote across the UK. That is most definitely not true. We have been trying to read the runes and the smoke for a very long time and being in an industry that has to continually adjust to outside factors on a sometimes-daily basis while on the road we are accustomed to extraneous demands. Taking a double-barrelled shotgun to
our feet was not anywhere in the equation.

I’m not an accountant, never wanted to be. I wanted to be a creative artist and performer who could ply my trade and earn a living across borders, and especially in Europe, our closest neighbours and as I said the third biggest music market in the world next to the USA and Japan. It appears that the only sector benefitting from all these new regulations are accountants and advisors, and all those costs will percolate through to album and concert ticket prices.

And all of this during a pandemic that has crippled the music industry and put thousands out of work for an indefinite time.
I always look for silver linings with regards to my own situation and the only thing I can grasp on to is that my own postponed tour gives me preparation time to take on these seemingly constantly changing regulations and find a way forward. Some may say visa/permit costs, tax changes etc are negligible and part of the ‘cost’ of this current mess. For an arena level band, that may be so. It’s mostly an accountancy issue and they will usually have a wider
organisation who can focus on paperwork, but for others at my level and below it’s the difference between having a tour and a career in the music business or not.

And now? Where am I?

A 32 date European and Scandinavian tour looming in September with rehearsals necessary in August; an increasingly raging virus, nationwide vaccinations still a long way off, no
insurance for anything Covid related, promoters suggesting renegotiations of contracts for potential social distancing (impossible and refused), vastly increased merchandise
commission of around 20% of the gross sales (plus VAT) expected as venues and corporate entities involved try to recover losses and all of the above previously mentioned.

Is it going to happen? I wouldn’t buy tickets and incur fees that are non-returnable until I knew for certain the tour was happening. I certainly can’t hold up my hand and say I will be on tour in September or at any point this year.

And now, take another step back on this and look from the other side. I am on tour, potentially unvaccinated. Our tour merchandiser faces the public every night. She contracts the virus and we have maybe 10 days before she shows symptoms, and we are all together on a bus every day. Meanwhile in 10 days we could be in 7 cities intermingling with house crews, journalists, promoters, members of the general public etc. One band, one bus - one
potential travelling super-spreading Covid generator.

The tour is scheduled to start in just over 8 months, and we are still in lockdown here for perhaps another month and beyond. We should be looking at applying for visas/ permits by the beginning of summer latest to ensure we are regulatory compliable? And that means I will need to pay out £15k for work permits/visas we might not even need and in my opinion shouldn’t even be required in the first place?

The ‘bandwagon’ was already stalled by the pandemic and now bureaucracy has slashed the tyres and thrown sand in the engine while laying a minefield on the road with no maps to trust.

All the info I’ve related comes from current valid and credible sources. It’s not ‘fake news’ or ‘Remainer bullshit’. This is what I have discovered so far and what is being revealed on a day-to-day basis - on government and official websites which are constantly updated - still remains vague and doesn’t address specific questions we genuinely need answers to. It’s all real and at the moment it’s all that we know now.

I genuinely despair at the current state of the music industry and the dreams that are being broken on these rocks. I’m 63 this year and immensely grateful for what the music industry and the fans of my music have given me over the last 40 years. I just can’t imagine what it’s like for a young artist in these present times. I planned to retire from live music in 2023 and have just lost 2 years on a road I seriously don’t know if I will ever revisit.

We, the music business, and industry of the UK are currently in a perilous state. After all we have given to the world over the last 50 years and more; the revenue and cultural recognition that has been provided to this country through the musicians and technicians
and every ancillary member of the live music communities with their writing, creations, and performances. We deserve better than this from our elected government. We need a rethink,
and we need it sooner rather than later as our future is in jeopardy

It’s 4 years since we packed up the family in Stonehaven and moved to Dorking in Surrey. For the most part, it has been a good move for us. I was in a cycle of new job&gt;redundancy/liquidation that was getting unbearable. Our mountain biking group of friends had fallen apart (sadly lost one of the old gang recently to suicide). Stonehaven was looking and feeling bleak. Our families are in Dundee and Perth, so we even felt a bit isolated from them. As my work is Revit/CAD/3D modelling for building services (with a stint of oil and gas whist in the Aberdeen area), most of the work out there was London. We took the decision to have a fresh start. I flew down for 2 interviews in one day and came away that night with 2 offers. For the most part it has been great - I’ve managed to get Ltd Company contracting in some really interesting projects. The boy is really enjoying school. The new one that came along is loving nursery. We have a great group of friends and the mountain biking scene in Dorking is amazing. Dorking itself is a great wee town too. But nothing could prepare me for just how busy the SE is! Thankfully the biking in the Surrey Hills is amazing and we don’t need to drive anywhere but my god it’s a mission if you actually want to have a wee daytrip over 20 miles away. 

The biggest cultural shock for me as a lover of most outdoor pursuits is the absence of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. Id never heard of a ‘bridleway’ until 4 years ago and never considered that you can’t ride a bike on a ‘footpath’. I got shouted at recently for riding with the kids on a footpath. What?! You mean  I can’t ride on this path that is wide enough and smooth enough to drive a bus down?! Madness! This also affects the other stuff I’d taken for granted - wild swimming, canoeing, wild camping etc. This will never change in this archaic Tory-loving country. 

So between that and doing a few more hours work most nights to pay for this ludicrous cost of living you’ll get an idea of how stifled I’m starting to feel. We’re starting to consider moving to the Glasgow area, possibly East Dumbartonshire mostly for the easy access to the hills for biking (and everything else I’m allowed to do!) and back towards family in Perth and Dundee. I’m actually starting to get quite excited about it! I’ve always really liked Glasgow and kind of wished I’d bypassed this whole thing and just moved that direction 4 years ago. But, ‘experiences’ etc.

The one problem is I have no idea how to even begin moving the boy out of/into school mid-term! He’s in Year 2 (Primary 3 in real money). It just seems like a chicken-egg-chicken situation. Anyone that has done the combined house-job-school move have any tips on where to begin?

As the dust settles on the arrest, tent, police raid, and tabloid search for a glimpse of Nicola Sturgeon or Peter Murrell, the Easter break has given everyone a chance to look around a bit.

For independence supporters the situation may look bleak, as even the SNP’s interim CEO Mike Russell says; “I don’t think independence can be secured right now; we need to work towards some co-ordinated campaigning” with a “new Yes movement.”

Independence is the life blood of the SNP, the reason members join and campaigners chap doors and distribute leaflets each election time. So, does that admission mean the SNP is terminally damaged? No – or at least not yet.

Support for independence is remarkably steady and a new, joint, concerted campaign might just appeal to Yessers, so long as it’s 100% genuine and speedily delivered. But more importantly, the SNP is still the only game in town for Scots who’ve given up on Westminster. And that’s a lot of people. Besides it isn’t the only party with problems.

Saturday’s Tory-supporting Telegraph proclaimed “Tory fury as Douglas Ross says Scots should vote Labour to oust SNP” – a position party chairman Craig Hoy MSP implausibly denied his boss had actually taken on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show.

Analysts predict the Tories are set for a drubbing in the English local elections and another Tory MP has been caught trying to sell his wares in a Times sting.

The Daily Mail columnist Richard “no friend to the Nats” Littlejohn has suggested 20 cops arriving for a dawn raid at the Sturgeon/Murrell home was over the top. Meanwhile, talk of a leadership re-run or a sub-party forming at Holyrood should be tempered by the fact of Kate Forbes’ daily tweets supporting Humza Yousaf. She may be playing a waiting game but internal opposition will find it hard to coalesce around an alternative leader who doesn’t challenge the newly elected incumbent.

Still, the SNP and Scottish Government face massive challenges – there’s no escaping the fact. It’s just that switching support to (probably) Labour means accepting a British state that shows no signs of being able to confront or reform itself. Au contraire.

You don’t need to be a card-carrying Republican to feel slightly nauseous as faux Coronation excitement ramps up daily. It seems we should suspend criticism of the million-pound event since community activists will replace z-list dignitaries at the event. Huzzah. We should be chuffed that in a cost-of-living crisis, King Charles has designed a “scaled down” event with just one new gold carriage and two new thrones which will last 90 minutes not the three hours spent on Queen Elizabeth’s ceremony in 1953.

Still, while the British and international press trills about the chance for a moment of coronation togetherness, Scotland stands with one eyebrow collectively arched.

Shetland is still the only council to vote against a bank holiday for staff on the May coronation weekend – happily, national holidays in Scotland are determined by councils. But in Westminster-run Northern Ireland, local elections have been postponed by two weeks to avoid a clash. Yip, a month after celebrations of the democratic breakthrough achieved by the Good Friday Agreement 25 years ago, local democracy must take second place to the coronation of an unelected head of state.

And bizarrely that’s quite unremarkable in an archaic British state half of Scotland would leave but most of Scotland would reform. A Panelbase poll in December 2022 found 55% of Scots would prefer an independent Scotland to be a republic rather than headed by King Charles – a result which aligns Scotland with Europe where 21 of 27 EU member states are republics with elected heads of state.

Even amongst the six European monarchies, Britain is an outlier – the only country still conducting an actual coronation ceremony. European monarchies have either replaced them with simpler events (like Denmark) or never practised coronations (like the Netherlands and Belgium). Indeed, most monarchies today just require a simple oath taken in the country’s legislature. But hey Britain – simple? That’s not what monarchy is about.

Rory Scothorne suggests the British royal family is not just regal eye-candy but “indicates to subjects that Britain is not like other states, and thus need not be held to similar standards. By proving we do things differently here, [the monarchy] helps us avoid the realisation that we actually do things worse. It is royalty, above all, that makes Britain’s conservative constitution popular.” Maybe, in England but not with Scots.

One month before C-Day, Scots have far fewer street parties planned than the rest of the UK – though of course, spontaneity might yet kick in. Still, last year only 14 events were held in Scotland to celebrate 70 years of the Queen on the throne. Across the UK, there were 16,000. When it comes to the cowed reverence and Union Jack emblazoned excitement that accompanies royalty, Scots tend to back the Bard: “The rank is but the guinea’s stamp, The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.”

The Panelbase poll did find 45% of Scots would keep the monarchy in an independent country, but I suspect they’d expect a seriously pared-down European-style monarchy – which clearly ain’t what “frugal” Charles is planning. This is just one part of the obsequious, foreluck-tugging reality Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party must tackle or meekly endorse. Which will it be?

We already know the answer. Ditto with all the other big issues. What chance a return to full-blooded public ownership beyond railways that are already halfway there, and the bantamweight arrival of Great British Energy to compete on the sidelines while the billion pound profit-making BP and Shell rock on? None.

What chance of a return to the EU or at least the single market? None

What chance of an end to the ramped up anti-immigrant rhetoric that fuelled the recent attack on an asylum seeking hotel? Some, but the virility test for the Labour leader will be keeping the horrific Rwanda deportation route open and stopping more boats on the Channel.

Indeed, what chance vigorous, open debate on these and other vital issues while an unofficial policy of “wheesht for a Labour Government” is operating? Monica Lennon MSP admitted as much last week as she joined the chorus of criticism over Labour’s attack ads, signed off by Keir Starmer, which claim Rishi Sunak doesn’t think child sex abusers should go to prison. Until now wheeshting was only for indy. Actually, everyone does it.

Scotland is waiting to see what arises from Peter Murrell’s arrest. Clearly, Humza has it all to do. But so does everyone else who would unseat him.",Troubled SNP is the only game in town for Yes supporters,2023-04-10 11:08:37

430,"No tenant in their right mind would do this, obviously, but the situation below happened to a friend and I don’t thing it’s legal.

They recently had a conversation with their landlord, in which the landlord informally informed them that the buy to let mortgage doubled in the last 12 months and they would have to evict my friend and sell the property in the near future because they cannot increase the rent and they are losing money. The mortgage is now almost double the rent my friend is paying.

But oh, the landlord had a “convenient little solution” and that’s where it goes wrong. If the tenant (no pressure) voluntarily made an offer to pay a slightly higher rent then that would save some time and that way the tenant can keep living there for longer. 

Like if the my friend turned around and said “oh you poor landlord, I know you’re struggling, I am too. So I want to pay you more, I don’t care about myself, I care about you”. It is obvious that no tenant would do this without being forced into it. Which defeats the purpose of the rent freeze if there is this big red flag of a loophole. Landlords can easily say “voluntarily offer us a higher rent or out you go. But do it voluntarily, it’s your idea not mine”. If they refuse then evict them, put the property on the market for a month to look like you want to sell, then “oh, changed my mind” and rent it at a higher price.

My friend is faced with 2 options now: agree to this solution and do as told regardless of the legality of things. Or await an eviction notice and find an other place, which will cost more because of other buy to let landlords doing something similar and putting properties on the market way above a living rent. It’s a loss loss situation.

Posting this mostly to give everyone in Scotland a new years laugh. Some fun parts

&gt;Even at Westminster Brexit is a topic politicians prefer to avoid. The ruling Conservatives tend to skirt it because leaving the EU has clearly not delivered the benefits they foresaw. Keir Starmer and his shadow cabinet treat Brexit as the Great Unmentionable for fear of alienating the Leave-voting Red Wall seats that Labour needs to win the next election.

My heart goes out to the English politicians ruining the UK because they're too scared to be honest under the FPTP system Labour and the Tories force on us like a cartel so they can cycle between themselves.

Speaking of the 'Great Unmentionable', I am once again asking for a single Scottish journalist to ask Sarwar why Scottish Labour are now a Brexit party?

&gt;It is true that the opinion polls have shown support for Brexit diminishing as the cost-of-living crisis has deepened, but the headlines are misleading. That support has fallen not because millions of Leavers have suddenly decided they voted the wrong way, but because they think the government has failed to exploit Brexit – not least by curbing immigration. Hence Nigel Farage’s recent threat to re-enter the political fray: “I spent a quarter of a century fighting for us to get Brexit, but I simply couldn’t stand aside and do nothing if this act of betrayal continues.”

Oh no, apparently a portion of England will go full gammon again and take votes from the Tories and Labour to vote for Farage/racism... whatever will we do about that 😱 Best get Sir Keir Starmer out stating too many foreigners are in the NHS and Rachel Reeves declaring more deportations are needed.

&gt;Suppose leading Remainers were unequivocally to state the obvious – that we will not seek another referendum for at least a generation; that the EU would not let us rejoin right now even if we voted to (and certainly not on the terms we previously enjoyed); and that not all the Brexiteers’ nostrums are wrong-headed. Levelling up, for example, is a laudable aim, as is weaning British industry off its dependence on cheap imported labour. 

Ah yes, democracy must stop for a period of time because people aren't allowed to change their minds if they feel they were lied to. Wonder where we've heard that one before 🤔

What is it with Brits and throwing toys out the pram if people on this island might be up for changing their mind? Or new electorate members come of age and want to send their parents to the shadow realm for screwing up their futures? Boomer tier pish that democracy has to stop for periods of time.

&gt;I also believe, as we enter 2023, that the mass of the British people are exhausted by the battles of the past six years and yearn to move on.

TL;DR: Moving from Ireland (the North bit) to Scotland due to a lack of resources and hope for someone a bit different to others (in my case, trans).

For the most part, people in that thread were very nice. Although the move won't be for a few years as I'll be needing to recover financially and physically from a major operation, as well as re-training in a few qualifications I'm still looking into a future over there. Talked to my partner about it and she's happy enough to move over with me.

But I'm still in the research stage and I'm wondering about the better places to live, factoring in the following:

Cost of living.

Safety. This is a big one, given the topic of that previous thread. My current town is pretty safe, but that's really the only reason I'm living here. Going elsewhere (especially Belfast) leads to a lot of shite from others.

Job prospects. This goes for both of us. Currently she works in a bank and I work as a carer, but I'm looking to change that soon. If times got tough I could pick up care shifts on the side with an agency, as I do have the qualifications.

Access to community/support. In my case job prospects would factor in here, too as the ideal job I'm aiming for would be a counsellor specialising in LGBT+ based support. It was also the main topic of that previous thread. A lot of people pointed out potential resources to me but I'm wondering what area would still have the best access.

Access to public transportation. Neither of us drive, so this is a big one. She grew up in Dublin so never really needed a car, whereas I get a bit too anxious behind the wheel. Would consider going back and finishing my lessons if there was no other option, though.

I'm very sure the SNP were expecting this too, I don't know what specifically they will plan to do next, other than the de-facto referendum, but these are some suggestions I have.

Sturgeon said today, the next step would be to look for the next thing that gives Scotland a chance to have their say, which would be the 2024/5 General Election (unless something unprecedented happens like a snap Holyrood/Westminster Election, or idk a referendum for a referendum lol). That means there's 2 more years before anything can happen.

In that time, the Scottish Government must build up support for independence. 

Potentially very controversial, but its all very good to say Scotland is being ignored however the reality is that polling doesn't support the claim that a majority want Scottish independence. If support for independence was made consistently high as it had been during the 2020-21 period, a mandate for a referendum would be impossible for Westminster to ignore.

There's a few ways this can be achieved, but the biggest shifts in opinion, IMO, will come from:

- 1. A **detailed**, costed, economic prospectus for independence. This would be difficult to gauge, but it's what's needed. People want numbers and hard figures, not promises. And that prospectus, if done correctly, would probably show a tough initial period, but the SNP/ Yes campaign should own that with confidence, show that they know the challenges and perhaps show what they will do to offset it as much as they can. Honesty and humility will go a long way.

They have 2 years to make an incredibly detailed paper. 

- 2. Better governance than Westminster. May be a bit obvious, but the whole reason behind the 2020-21 increase in independence support was that it was perceived that Scotland was performing better than Westminster, and had better leadership is response to the pandemic. 

In this cost of living crisis, achieving the same will go a _long_ way. I know Holyrood is limited in its powers but it must do whatever it can. Giving nurses a good enough pay deal and avoiding NHS strikes, giving teachers a good enough pay deal, giving rail workers a good enough pay deal, showing that Scotland listens to key workers. The UK Health Secretary is refusing to even engage in any conversation with the nurses planning to strike, that clear divide in attitude should be made even more stark.

Breaking the deadlock is what is needed in the next step of the independence campaign.

Obviously many other things that SNP / Yes campaign will need to do, but those are Two of the biggest things that will shift opinion, IMO.

Now, I'm just some random guy on reddit, my opinion on what is needed doesn't matter to the independence campaign, but I believe this route is the only possible way to an independence referendum _and_ a Yes win.

Let me know if you disagree, or agree, what other suggestions you may have. Happy to have a discussion. :)",The next steps for an IndyRef,2022-11-23 16:47:15

&gt;  
The turmoil that sprang from Liz Truss’s mini-budget boosted faith in the economic case for Scottish independence, according to a poll.  
&gt;  
&gt;Voters were equally optimistic about their fortunes in the event of a break-up of the UK as they would be about remaining in the status quo, according to research for Ipsos. Its survey found 43 per cent of the population believed Scotland’s economy would be better off after independence, exactly the same proportion as those who favoured the prospects of the United Kingdom. Ten per cent said it would make no difference and 4 per cent were unsure.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Nicola Sturgeon](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/nicola-sturgeon?page=1) has sought in recent months to capitalise on the chaos wrought by the [mini-budget](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mini-budget-panic-may-be-spreading-to-property-funds-vhfd96k35) of September 23, which included £45 billion of unfunded taxcuts and led to pandemonium in the markets, a fall in the value of the pound and rises in the cost of UK government borrowing and mortgage rates.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel survey, which was carried out last month during the dying days of Truss’s premiership, found that the public in Scotland and across the UK were increasingly gloomy about their economic prospects as the cost of living escalated.  
&gt;  
&gt;In all four nations, people were more likely to think the economies of the rest of the Union would be worse off — (37 per cent) than better off (20 per cent) [if Scotland became independent](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/topic/scottish-independence?page=1), according to the research. It found that a higher proportion, 45 per cent, of people in Scotland thought that the remaining UK economies would be worse off in the event of secession.  
Emily Gray, the managing director of Ipsos Scotland, said: “With the [cost of living crisis](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/welcome-to-the-new-normal-0dvkwdrkg) deepening, most people expect gloomy economic times ahead and the measures that governments at both Holyrood and Westminster set out over the coming months to help weather the crises may well shift public views on Scotland’s economic future further.”  
&gt;

Unpopular opinion time. 

I am getting fed up with all these people striking in the public sector. Yes it sucks that cost of living is through the roof but you are now begining to harm everyone, which I know is the point of the strike until you get your way. 

Plenty of people out there getting no pay rises or certainly not anywhere near 5%. 

There comes a point where enough is enough. 

And the line has to me made at ScotRail for me. 

Do I think that extra money should be found for the NHS pay rises? Of course. 

But the train system is failing due to its unreliability and cost. It failed as a private business and has gone nationalised. If it was still privately owned, there would be job losses and cut backs.  

This strike will have an impact on every business in the cities as Christmas trade suffers. It will have an impact on people's mental health as they can unwind from their jobs at weekends, such as supporting the national team at Murray field or getting to the pub. 

It's completely selfish and I really hope that the government hold fast and make an example of them.

&gt;The Resolution Foundation said such a switch would have stark consequences for families struggling with soaring living costs. A single disabled adult on universal credit would lose £380, while a working single parent with one child would lose £478, and a working couple with three children would lose £978.
&gt;
&gt;Jack Leslie, a senior economist at the thinktank, said: “While the significant Treasury savings may look tempting in the context of its attempts to fill its fiscal hole, the cost to 10 million working-age families and almost every pensioner would be huge.”

Owing to a strike by refuse workers, mounds of rubbish bags lay piled up on the streets; noxious slime oozed onto pavements from overflowing public bins; and a foul stench hung heavy in the air.**

Initially, the SNP Government tried to pin the blame on Edinburgh’s Labour-run council, but that strategy unravelled when workers in a string of other local authorities walked out too. Nor is there yet an end in sight. This week, unions rejected an offer of a 5% pay rise, plus a one-off payment for lower earners, saying it would do too little to help the half of Scottish council workers who are paid less than £25,000pa. Scotland is in the midst of a summer of discontent, next week, schools and nurseries will close for three days as a result of strikes by cleaners and other support staff. And though Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP administration has now offered extra funding to help settle the disputes, critics blame it for slashing local authority budgets in the first place, leaving them ill-prepared for the cost-of-living crisis. This is yet another setback, to add to the long list the SNP has presided over. It suits Sturgeon to blame Westminster; but the country’s real problem is that it is governed by people who’ve no real interest in the day-to-day grind of government. They haven’t joined the SNP to raise school standards, or cut NHS waiting lists. They have only one real goal: the creation of an independent Scotland.

You might expect the escalating strikes to pose a threat to Sturgeon’s grip on power, But the divisive issue of independence remains very potent in Scotland, and while that debate rages, other matters “tend to take a backseat”.

Fast forward to 2020 and I managed to land my first programming job at an absolute dump at the height of covid in a storage container (A story for another time). That job got me on the ladder to where I am now so I'm not so mad anymore. 

Now I'm on £27k and I work from home, which is amazing for both my sanity and fuel.

**General cost of living:** We shop at Aldi and even there we are starting to notice it.

**Energy:** We will be coming to the end of our fixed rate soon after moving in.

**Mortgage:** If our house isn't built by the time our mortgage offer is valid until then we will need to reapply and will easily cost a few extra £100 a month. 

**All other money:** Just been saving it for the move.

Once we move all of our bills are set to rise, but we took that into account at the time and made sure that we wouldn't be on the breadline. Things have changed a bit since our original figures.

Everything is on the rise, and while we are in a relatively good position, I am worried about the future. We will have enough to get by month to month, and if we save for a few months we will maybe even be able to go on a holiday. 

But what if the washing machine breaks? What if the car needs repairing, what if our dog falls ill and the insurance doesn't cover it? What about my friends and family that are already on the breadline? What about my family that has already decided that they just won't pay energy bills this winter and face the backlash at another time? Why is anyone having to make these sorts of decisions?

So tell me, if Labour are supposedly so upset at the SNP and Nicky being ""obsessed with independence"" why are they making a choice that very much gestures at them being so obsessed with independence they're rather side with a right-wing party?

Fuck this fossil of a party, their supporters is just Orange boomers who remember the poll tax, middle-class Coldplay 90s libs and clueless hipsters who think wearing red makes you socialist automatically, and frankly I'm sick of foreigners on left-wing subs saying ""um acksually you need to vote Labour sweaty"" because they think this is the ""good-enough tactical-vote liberal party"" that it is in England. It is not, and this is proof. If Labour and the Toris chum up in England, it will be the start of the fucking Biblical Armageddon, here it's buisness as usual.

What can I say, I want to fuck off to Livingston or Dundee, it's not like the housing price would give me much of a choice to stay here anyway.",Fuck the Labour party and Edinburgh Labour,2022-05-26 14:00:40

552,"There have been lots of comments here about the cost of living crisis and rate of inflation This hopefully helps explain why inflation is so high, according to the Bank of England. 

The one small silver lining in this shit storm is inflation is expected to fall to 2% after 2 long years. 

“There is more than one reason why the rate of inflation is so high now. 

It started to rise in 2021 and that was partly to do with the economy recovering from the Covid crisis. 

Economies around the world, including in the UK, opened up after Covid restrictions eased. And then people naturally wanted to start buying things again.

But businesses selling some of those things couldn’t get enough of them to their customers. This caused prices to rise - especially for goods coming from abroad.

Added to that, there was a very sharp rise in energy (oil and gas) prices. All of these things pushed prices (and the rate of inflation) up.

In early 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to more large increases in the price of things like energy and food. 

The lockdowns in China (due to Covid) are also making it harder to import some goods to the UK. So that is pushing up prices too. 

These two factors explain the large majority of the increase in inflation.”

555,"Student here struggling to find finance for my accommodation
 So basically I'm planning to move to Glasgow from the western Isles to study.
My issue is the the course I'm doing is not covered by saas because of its level, therefore I do not have a student loan to cover the cost of my accommodation living away and would need to pay the costs myself, which even with all my savings I would struggle to pay, not even including my cost of living. 
Does anyone know of any way I can cover my accommodation cost such as alternative loans for students?

It's a college that I'm doing and it's at NQ level as a preperation for a course that is covered by saas, I've looked around and there isn't anything similar closer to the western Isles.",student in need of funding help/advice,2022-05-01 23:50:03
558,"My partner and I are considering moving to Scotland in the future. How is the cost of living in different parts of Scotland? We were looking at Inverness, maybe Pitlochry.. around those areas. We saw that some houses are being sold at £60-100K but we have no idea what the wages are/ cost of living. So we're just curious. How hard is it to get a good job/ residence permit etc. 

Can you maybe provide some pros and cons to living in Scotland?

Thank you!!",Moving to Scotland,2022-04-24 15:15:21
559,"
I’ve just read a story about an 11 year old boy that asked if a plumber, already at his charitably, would like to buy his PlayStation so that his Mum and Dad could afford to eat with him.

I’m heart broken, the Tories are always banging on about the UK being the fastest growing economy in the G7 (proven lie), and being the world’s 5th largest economy- so how does it get like this?

How do we have 2.5 million people needing to use foodbanks?

A number set to grow even higher, experts at the Trussell trust think that nearly 1 in 10 parents are veru likely to use food banks within the next three months.
Almost 20% of parents in the last year have gone without food to make sure their child has enough to eat.

People are already reporting that they can no longer afford to use their oven’s because the cost of energy is extortionate.

And some food banks are asking people not to donate ropt vegetable and potatoes because people cannot afford the longer cooking times these need to undergo.

The government has totally outsourced its moral obligation to provide for the people they govern to the charity of those same people.

They needed to be shamed and publicly pressured to provide free school meals to children during Covid, and promptly outsourced that to a Tory donor who provided woefully inadequate amounts and qualities of food, and then pocketed the difference.

The UK might have one of the worlds largest economies but the vast majority of that wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very small number of people. The wealthiest 10% control 43% of the wealth, the wealthiest 1% controls almost 25% of all of the wealth of the UK.
Meanwhile the least well off 50% control only 9%.

This income inequality is growing, as the government strips more and more publicly owned services, selling them off to “preferred bidders”, classmates from university/ private schools/ companies they own shares in.

12 year of Tory Austerity, corruption, cronyism, law breaking, lying, and outright theft has left the country on the brink.

The cost of living crisis is getting worse, food prices, fuel prices, energy prices, are all set to rise, but wages are stagnant, and, rather than take a cut in profits the huge businesses already boasting of record profits, would rather have actual blood on their hands, because people will die from this.",Strap in for a long pointless rant folks,2022-04-20 21:32:01
