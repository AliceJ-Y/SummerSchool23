8,"Both Port Elizabeth and East London have unique features and attractions, making it difficult to determine which one is better. Here are some factors to consider when comparing the two cities:

Location: Port Elizabeth is located in the Eastern Cape, while East London is located in the Eastern Cape and is closer to the Wild Coast. Port Elizabeth is closer to popular destinations such as Addo Elephant Park and Jeffreys Bay, while East London is closer to the Wild Coast beaches.

Climate: Both cities have a similar climate, with warm summers and mild winters. However, Port Elizabeth tends to be slightly drier than East London, with less rainfall.

Attractions: Port Elizabeth is known for its beaches, such as Humewood Beach, and its wildlife attractions, such as the Kragga Kamma Game Reserve. East London is known for its surfing beaches, such as Nahoon Beach, and its cultural attractions, such as the East London Museum.

Cost of living: The cost of living in both cities is relatively affordable compared to other major cities in South Africa. However, Port Elizabeth tends to be slightly more expensive than East London in terms of housing and other living expenses.

Ultimately, the decision on which city is better depends on personal preferences and priorities. Both cities have their unique features and attractions, making them both great options to visit or live in.

\- People feel bad for taking something that they feel someone worse off would benefit more from  
\- The people who are most likely to buy yellow sticker items are working themselves, or simply don't have the freezer space for said items

22," Hi all,

I'm  in a nasty situation where after coming back from a 2 week holiday I  find my bedroom in an unlivable condition. A terrible smell of urine,  damp walls to the point water is still dropping from them and my  mattress destroyed. All in all the room is no longer in a usable state.

Turns  out my landlord was aware of this and checked the room while I was  gone, but did not think the damage is that noticeable. However, he got  in contact with the neighbor letting agency and we agreed that they will  cover the cost of the damages done.

Now,  this happened 4 days ago and since then I've been forced to live in my  living room sleeping on the floor for almost throwing up to the nasty  smell of urine all this time. I also work from home which made it even  worse. I am incredibly frustrated at this point with my mental health  down the drain and I don't think it is fair that I pay full rent when  the house is not in a condition I can comfortably live in. Not to  mention, all the time I wasted cleaning and drying the walls so a  painter can come and repaint it asap to get rid of the smell.  Researching services around the city to fix the other damages caused by  the leak.

I told them I want  compensation for my inconveniences. My landlord told me to get in touch  with the agency that is in charge of the neighbors above and ask them to  cover it. I am planning to ask them for a week's worth of rent and  another £200 for my time wasted. From what I understand I will be able  to get back into the room next Monday.

**HIGH PRIORITY**

* Walkable — Pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, nice parks, and a good transit system. Bonus for good biking infrastructure.
* Relatively Affordable — Not necessarily in terms of absolute cost-of-living, but best value. For example, London checks most of our boxes but is also VERY expensive. Alternatively, Liverpool seems to to also check a lot of our boxes, but is relatively more affordable.
* Football — A vibrant football culture, both in terms of number of teams in the top 2-3 flights of British football, and how deeply woven into a city's history and culture football is. Newcastle, Leeds, and Nottingham are a few smaller cities that seem to fit this criteria (is that true?).

**LOWER PRIORITY**

* Well-Connected — Relatively easy/direct access to the rest of the UK, especially London (by rail or plane). Don't mind a longer journey, but ideally nonstop.
* Character — Obviously subjective, but we really love to wander around cities with beautiful architecture, thoughtfully designed parks, and unique neighborhoods. Looking for any city with a strong identity, that is (ideally) reflected in some way in its urban landscape.

**CURRENT CANDIDATES**

This is a list of cities we are currently considering, based on our own research and a few suggestions from friends. Most of them are much larger, international cities, so I'd especially love suggestions for small/medium-sized cities that meet our criteria.

* **London** — Cost of living is a big negative. Also mega-cities have their own feel, which we're trying to avoid.
* **Liverpool** — Seems like a good option, but pretty expensive.
* **Glasgow** — Another great option, but also pretty expensive.
* **Edinburgh** — My favorite city on the list, but very expensive. Also not as big of a football culture there AFAIK...
* **Newcastle —** Don't know much about this city, but it seems like a good, more affordable option.
* **Manchester** — Not sure about this one.
* **York?**","Walkable, football-loving, and relatively affordable cities to live in for 3-4 months?",2023-02-26 15:25:03

The question is, is there some data somewhere where I can see where in the UK one can expect to be economically better off?

I think the right index in question is ""real disposable income"", where from gross salary one subtracts taxes and basic ""survival"" costs of living (rent, food etc). What one is left with, is money that can be used as one wishes: investments, travelling, etc.

80,"I started in a new company at the end of October, from a company I loved with an awful boss (under whom I would never progress, but the team was great) to a job with better pay at a much larger company. 


From the day I started it has been pretty bad; it’s a huge company and the pre-start onboarding was so promising. The day I started I turned up and no-one was expecting me, my line manager had one call with me for about 30 mins before I had my first huge client call, with little training or onboarding for the first few weeks. I felt so isolated.

I had no intro to my colleagues (and the team structure doesn’t make much sense) so I offered myself up for any work and I got stuck in, and I was smashing it professionally. 

It’s hybrid working and hot-desking so when I went into the office I wouldn’t know anyone. There wasn’t much communication apart from the projects I took upon myself or the direct emails from my boss; no proper training (I’m relatively experienced in agency life but no time was spent explaining process, company structure etc, probably because my line manager only started a month before me). 

Little did I know, I was left off all internal comms emails until today (i found out in December and have logged IT tickets with no response). I missed all the Christmas socials, all the social initiatives, all the trainings and things that connect you with colleagues, all the cost of living help. 

I’ve now been lumped with huge projects across teams, no real management and it’s horrific; I’m regularly working til late in the evening (which I swore never to do) and have reached out to my line manager repeatedly for help with no response. Ironically I was nominated as star of the week for 6 straight weeks when I first started because I was so “self sufficient”. I’m now in charge of three big programmes across random teams that don’t communicate and I’m struggling. 

I have been told by colleagues this is not normal and I started at the wrong time, but I’m not sure.

Q- is it better to cut my losses and look elsewhere? In a large company can I go above my boss’ head and ask to move teams, even if I’ve not met the senior managers?

A) Move to Birmingham. Same salary
B) Move to London, expected salary increase of £15k
C) Stay where I am

108,"A bit of background, I’m a Male, 28, living in the UK. I’d consider myself reasonably good looking, not anything special but not bad looking by any stretch. I have never had trouble with attracting a girlfriend.

I’m 5’10 with a slim/athletic build as I’m an active runner doing 30 - 50 miles a week throughout the year, so I’m toned and relatively lean. 

In the past year, I got successive promotions as well as the business buying out a smaller one, so I all of a sudden inherited a lot more staff, responsibility and used this position to negotiate a much higher salary than I’ve ever had before. This means I’ve some disposable income after savings and small investments.

This is all framing for the question: I have gynecomastia that I’ve always been very self conscious about. I love swimming and don’t mind going where I don’t know anyone, but avoid doing it with friends. I am picky with what t shirts I’ll wear because I feel it’s noticeable. It’s been the biggest damage to my self-esteem since I was about 12. My girlfriend doesn’t care one bit, but I’m starting to think of the surgery. This would be to make me feel more comfortable in myself, I feel bizarre when I take my top off and have a toned midriff, shoulders and arms but a puffy, fatty breast region. I hate always being drawn to looking at the area or messing with my clothes to cover it. 

I’ve seen a few places offer consultations. Have any men started the process, had the surgery or thought about it? I’d consider going abroad if I knew the aftercare was okay and it was safe, but I’d rather UK based surgery if possible. I’d rather keep the cost around £3k or less, but willing to go more if it needs it. Thoughts?

109,"Hospital accommodation charging full term residents much more than oversees nurses - is this allowed?

I’m not sure if I can ask this question here but I was wondering…

I work at a hospital and I live at their on site accommodation, lived here for almost 4 years and I’ve been paying £650 since I’ve moved in. This includes: 

Bills
Council tax 
Cleaners  

I’m guessing our hospital regularly does oversees recruitment programmes and as a result I have to move to the building next door (as they want to make this building for shorter term residents which is annoying in itself as the building I’m going to has longer term residents with more items but we now have less space). 

They originally tried to ask us to move out but I said I originally signed a rolling contract with no tenancy term and that they couldn’t kick me out essentially. 

I was speaking to the new tenants (Filipino nurses) and they just informed me that they don’t have to pay anything for the first 2 months and the next 4 months they pay £200. They then have to find somewhere else to live dependant on whether there’s other rooms available. 

I was wondering as they allowed to charge me so much more than my new flat mates? (I know £650 isn’t huge during a cost of living crisis but I do feel it’s unfair to have such a discrepancy). If so is there someone I could message at my Trust about this as I don’t feel the accommodation are very helpful whatsoever (I’ve had a tumble dryer in the kitchen broken for the last 4 months)",Are they allowed to charge new tenants much less than myself for literally the exact same accommodation?,2023-01-18 16:50:04
112,"I should explain the relationship to clarify why 'sorry I can't make it' doesn't feel sufficient. She has been stricken by tragedy throughout her life, initially this is what made us close.

Her mum, my would-be step sister (3 years my senior) was a 'flighty sort'. Had her aged around 20 and couldn't cope. My niece therefore spent much of her infancy and early years being raised by my mother, while I was in my late teens still living at home. I played with her, changed the odd nappy, taught her to write her name etc. She was more like a baby sister really.

I'm not great with dates, hence a bit vague but her grandad (my mums partner) died when she was around 5 years old. From then she lived with her mum &amp; maternal grandmother mostly, but still spent most weekends etc with my mum. I was still around but growing a family of my own so less involved. She was only about 15-16 when her mum died in dubious circumstances. Details were hushed but drugs were involved, she stayed with her grandmother but maintained close extended-family type relationships. About 5 years ago my mum died, and around 2020/21 her grandmother died too  Two of her mothers siblings are alive somewhere but crazy fuckup types so I believe contact with them was dropped. Suffice to say, my older brother and (slightly moreso) myself are pretty much the closest 'family' she has.

Despite all that the woman is an absolute angel. Her main employment is with a charity for abused women, kind of like specialist social worker stuff. She has a couple of side hustles going, barely stops working. Her fiancée is some sort of engineer &amp; does loads of overseas work. They're doing well for themsekves and thoroughly deserve it so I'm really proud of her and pleased for them.

They recently announced their engagement and she visited me to ask if I'd come &amp; bring my kids to the wedding - in Poland....

After divorce 3 years ago, my fairly low income doesn't stretch very far. I'm just about getting by, but the current inflation etc has gobbled up almost all my disposable income. The reason they want to have the wedding in Poland is because it's significantly cheaper for them than holding it here. She says most of the planned long weekend event is catered etc but quick reckoning makes flights, hotels and a couple of meals etc for myself, current partner &amp; my two kids will run me at least a couple of thousand £s. With the way things are I might just about be able to pull that together (for summer 2024) but it would mean no meals out/treats/outings/new clothes etc etc for the better part of 2 years. I can't justify that for one weekend away, no matter how much I love her.

She also mentioned that they could help me with the cost, or she'd rather rearrange to have the wedding here than not have me there. I can't accept that sort of charity, it's just the way I am - if I can't pay my own way I don't do things / go places. I would be deeply ashamed and almost resentful to accept that. At the same time, I don't want her to compromise on the wedding she wants &amp; completely deserves for the sake of me attending.

This has been at the forefront of my mind for days and I've barely slept for worrying over it, so turning to reddit for mass advice: How do I tell her I can't/don't want to go to her wedding?",How do I tell my niece that I can't attend her wedding?,2023-01-14 07:19:46

117,"We had an offer accepted on a property in September three days before our wedding. The property is a large, detached house that has been split into two flats; one downstairs and a two-floor mezzanine upstairs. We are in the process of buying the upstairs flat.

Everything started off amazingly well: we managed to get our mortgage offer confirmed literally the day of the budget change, so we locked in 3.92%. The offer is valid until 31st March 2023. 

Last week the estate agent told us we could expect to exchange this week, but our solicitor returned with a few more concerns. We responded that we were also concerned over how long it was taking for simple questions to be answered and asked them to give the seller and their solicitor a deadline because we were concerned about the mortgage offer running out. If it runs out, we basically can no longer afford the property.

This put the wind up them because our solicitor called today to say that they’ve finally got back to her and it turns out they have an ongoing noise dispute with the person living in the flat below. The freeholder was contacted for context as the person in the downstairs flat went straight to the freeholder for resolution. The freeholder has sided with the downstairs neighbour because the upstairs seller has removed all their carpets and has hardwood flooring. The downstairs neighbour claims this breaks the quiet enjoyment covenant and claims she can hear footsteps, furniture movement and spoken voice. 

It is worth noting that the freeholder confirmed this has been going on for quite a few years, and that the downstairs flat owner is ‘unusual.’ They seem very unhelpful and were very rude to the solicitor enquiring about it - possibly sick of people asking about?

It takes approximately 3 minutes to Google and find out that general low-grade sounds of living like footsteps, the sound of children playing or crying, cooking smells etc. are generally acceptable and expected in a home. 

We love the flat, it ticks every box for us, but we really don’t want to proceed with a property that is going to potentially cost us our sanity if the elderly lady downstairs is constantly sniping because she heard a footstep or a cat meowing. We intend to start a family within the next year or two, and are also concerned that if she’s already complaining about two retirees walking about upstairs, what misery will she cause complaint about a crying baby or an enthusiastic toddler?

Of course, the downstairs neighbour may very well have a valid complaint, but having been inside the property we honestly can’t see how she would be able to hear anything beyond the occasional thump if something hit the floor with force. 

Basically, we’re looking for advice on whether it’s a good idea to still proceed. We love this place, and if we don’t buy it we might not be able to buy for a long time. On the other hand, we have no guarantee this dispute can be resolved if it’s been going on for years, especially if the ‘unusual’ neighbour is calling the shots.

But then, I know that if there was something in there I wanted, I could get it for a fraction of the price of other shops, and help out a cause at the same time.

So given the cost of living, and since websites/apps like Vinted have proven there's a market for second hand clothes alone, surely a solution to the problem is being able to browse a charity shop's catalogue of stuff in the same way you can do for retail brands. Item comes in, shop assistant takes a picture and adds a few details, and it gets added to the app. Then you could reserve it/pay, go in, pick up the item &amp; leave.

I've been learning to create websites and apps for a few years now, and I'd happily give this a go.

Generally we finished uni, stayed at home for year to save cash. Some people bought cars and moved into rental accommodation while it was still affordable to live on your own outside London. 

Many of moved down to London to start our careers. Flat sharing and HMOs were actually cheap even in the nice parts of London. Buying was still almost impossible thought however I don't recall aspiring for home ownership back then and even after the rent there was plenty of play money.

Cost of living wasn't really a problem, there was no iPhone but the iPod was all the rage.  The internet was something you could only access on a PC, not like today where everyone is permanently online. We definitely spent more of our lives offline than online.

Social media was only just starting but it wasn't something that people really depended on for communication. Texting (SMS) was all the rage. We didnt really have social media pressures.

I think we were mentally healthier and definitely happier. 

I have friends who now have young adult children and when we talk about their troubles, financial, mental, the amount of anxiety out there. Pressures of social media. The lockdown years didn't help and I think some people have been permanently effected by that experience.

I'm 26m and I grew up in East Yorkshire but moved to London at 18 for university and have lived there since.

I'm leaning towards starting in the Stockton office. My thoughts are:

Advantages:
- Cheaper cost of living.
- Closer to family.
- Ability to 'settle down' in an area that's much cheaper. 
- I'm single for over a year now so no consideration for partner having to move with me. 
- I want to own and live in a decent house at some point and I won't be getting any help or inheritance from my parents. (No disrespect to them, they are fantastic parents and I owe my relative success to them).

Disadvantages:
- Moving away from all my friends. 
- Town where the office is isn't known for being a great place to live. 
- Not as much to do around Teesside as there is in London. 
- If I get a partner in this area, there won't be as many local job opportunities and I could be tied down in the future.

With the radiator looking fairly new I believed it could still be in guarantee so i then contacted the previous owner who said they believed they got it from xxxx. 

I spoke with the company and they sent me an email containing the previous owners purchase and details etc. It showed on there the radiators were purchased in 2016 and looking at the website it shows the radiators have a guarantee of 15 years.

Following my conversation with the company they stated - 

The radiator is out of stock 
They have no idea when they will come back in stock 
They offered us a single panel radiator when we have a two panelled radiator. 

I then emailed back and stated - 

With them not knowing if they're getting in or when and especially over the winter season where we will have to wait for an unknown time, this will cost more money as we will only have 1 working radiator to heat our living room and it is smaller. 

I asked if with them not able to uphold their guarantee on this product nor give us a definitive date, can they not pay to get it from another company or reimburse us if we was to buy it from somewhere else.

I also asked for when the guarantee runs out.

I then got a bit of a rude email from the operations Manager -

We are not obliged to provide a replacement of any kind as you are not the purchaser and only the person who bought the productv can actually make a claim. Therefore we have offered to do this to help you out.

Is that true regarding a guarantee? Because surely the guarantee is on the product just like a window would be.

Are kids getting bullied for coats? (When I was at school you would get bullied for wearing your bag on both shoulders). Or are schools not letting the kids put them anywhere?
Or is it a fashion thing? Are they trying to get sent home for being drenched????

So the only cons would be the more expensive cost of living (not even that much).

234,"Hi Reddit London,

My partner and I are trying very hard to find an HMO licensed 2 bedroom property to rent in London with friends (*either 1 friend or 1 couple*) due to the rising cost of living. We are in a position where we cannot afford a 1 bed flat, but cannot find a 2 bed flat either because of HMO regulations that are super confusing and not clearly defined.

Letting Agents do not understand the rules well and they refuse to even talk with you the moment they realise an HMO may be needed. Landlords on the other hand are not bother to get the license mainly for **three** **reasons**:

1 ) **First**, the costs - £1000 to £1500 license cost + about £500 to £1000 fees, but valid for 5 years.  
2 ) **Second**, they do not meet the requirements for safety and room size. Nothing they can do unless they spend a lot to remodel the place, which they have no reason to do.  
3 ) **Third**, there are no restrictions from the Local Councils to incentivise or lock landlords into needing a license. Landlords can decide to simply rent to families or those that form 1 household only, in which case they do not need an HMO license.

*This naturally blocks reasonable groups of people, such as 3-4 friends, looking to rent together to save some money due to landlords not bothering to get an HMO license. In essence, the purpose of HMO licensing (to protect tenants from overcrowding and health hazards) in those reasonable scenarios tends to add, rather than alleviate, pressure to the housing crisis*.

**We discovered on Reddit that this seems to be the experience of a lot of people in London** looking for a flat/house to rent, thus I decided to share our research data on Boroughs across London and their effective licensing schemes.

I encourage all who read this post and have experience dealing with HMOs, including advise on how to find a way to rent a property legally, to share their experience and knowledge.  
Please, also do correct the data if you find faults!

**My Data to Date (November 2022)**:

&gt;Boroughs that operate **additional licensing schemes (3+ people or 2 households)** are: Barnet, Brent, Camden, Ealing, Enfield, Greenwich, Hackney, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Haringey, Harrow, Havering, Hounslow, Kingston upon Thames, Lewisham, Westminster, Lambeth, Newham, Redbridge, Southwark, Tower Hamlets (*except for those in the pre 2014 wards of Weavers, Whitechapel, Spitalfields and Banglatown*), Waltham Forest, Islington  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Boroughs that operate **selective licensing schemes (1 person/1 couple etc)** are:  
Barking &amp; Dagenham, Bexley, Brent, Ealing, Hackney, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, Harrow, Newham, Redbridge, Southwark, Tower Hamlets &amp; Waltham Forest, Islington  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Boroughs that operate **ONLY mandatory licensing schemes (5+ people)** are:  
Bromley, Croydon, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, Merton, Richmond Upon Thames, Sutton, Wordsworth, City of London, Hilingdon

What you would discover is that good number of boroughs that operate **Additional Licensing Schemes** are also operating **Selective Licensing Schemes**. Overall, the conclusion is that if you want to share with friends (*where you form 3+ people or 2+ households*) you need to look at boroughs that operate **Mandatory Licensing Only Schemes** (*compulsory accross England*).

304,"TLDR: bought property, but rental landlord refuses to accept surrender because she ‘can’t meet the new tenants’ as she’s moved to Australia. 

My partner and I were fortunate enough to finally save up enough to buy our own property recently. As part of this process and moving into our own flat, we have to surrender our rental lease 4 months early. 

Our rental agency was alerted 6 weeks in advance, once we were fairly certain of exchange, and they even had the ad for the rental property ready to go back up on their website etc. The letting manager of the rental agency was very confident as she assured me through her almost 20 year career she had never seen an owner refuse. She had the paperwork drawn up already. All that was left to do was for the owner to agree to surrender.

Through this entire process the owner was dragging their feet, not responding to the agent. 2 days before the rental was to be relisted, they replied that they’re ‘not comfortable with sourcing new tenants that they cannot meet prior to their move in as they are now living in Australia.’

This doesn’t make sense to us for a couple reasons. We live in London. Rental has gone up in this area on average 15% since we moved in - she would have more to gain monetary wise by getting new tenants. When we put up the property ourselves on social media, we had 26 enquiries on the waiting list and counting. Most of which were willing to pay 12 months up front for rent. The rental agency themselves had multiple prospective tenants lined up already. 

Owner increases rent. Agency makes commission again. And we get to move out early. Win-win-win right? Apparently not. 

Ethically, this is disturbing as well. At the height of the cost of living crisis, we’ll be forced to pay rent, utilities(?), and council tax for an empty property whilst other people out there are stuggling to even find accomodation. All because the landlord can’t work out how to use zoom or teams???

308,"I'm a 26 year old male in the UK whose life has disintegrated over the past few years. I am now on the precipice of another low - about to fail a Masters - and would be grateful from some advice on how I may be able to turn my life around.

The last few years have been very difficult for me. After academic success at school and A levels, I earned a place to a good university. My problems began here as I suffered some issues with my appearance and health issues following some freak side effects to a medication which unfortunately remain to this day. That plunged me into depression which proved refractory to treatment and despite seeing multiple therapists over the years this is still something I suffer from today. Despite this, I was able to muddle through my degree, managing to work maybe 25-35 hours a week or so and get a strong 2.1. I was told I had a strong CV, given the quality of the uni I went to and some good work experience, and managed to get a job as a journalist. 

In my final year at uni, however, my health issues worsened. I began suffering from what I have since learned are textbook symptoms of ALS, and with things having worsened over the past few years, and other illnesses being ruled out, I am now on the threshhold of being diagnosed with this (given I now suffer from quite considerable muscle weakness throughout my body, this is a really quite likely diagnosis, although not definite). Even before ALS was formally on the table, I was suffering from worsening physical and mental health issues and struggled at my job. I have always found writing historically difficult and unpleasant, so journalism was, on reflection, a poor field to try and get into. I took the job out of panic, frankly, as it was the first graduate job I applied for and I happened to get it, and given the job market felt I couldn't turn it down.

This was a disaster. I struggled to write articles to the required standard, could not focus at work, didn't get on with any of my coworkers (not arguments, just nothing in common/no connection), and was widely regarded as a liability. After a few years of increasingly poor performances from me - an awful cycle emerged where my boss lost faith in me and so stopped investing in my development, I lost faith in them and found it harder to work hard and motivate myself - things came to a head. As my health worsened I also became increasingly jaded about my job and its social importance. 

At the end of the fixed term contract (2 years) I was not offered a full-time job and would not have taken one even if I had been offered it. I then made the second really poor career decision and decided that I would try and do a research masters in English Lit, my undergraduate subject. Why I thought this was a good idea I honestly don't know. At the time, I was convinced I was going to die imminently (as I still believe, given my health issues) and so thought 'well, maybe I can use this as the basis of a book, or something to leave a legacy'. I started the course fairly well, but unfortunately my health deteriorated again. This, about a month into the course, was when doctors started raising ALS as a serious possibility ((I'd worried about it before, but it wasn't as all-encompassing as it would become then). Mental health tanked again, and I just lost faith in my degree. I have done probably an average of 10 hours of work a week over the past year, spending most of my time in a depressive daze of eating and watching trash TV, and have unsurprisingly completely failed the masters.  

The 30k thesis is due in tomorrow and I physically cannot write and submit anything of sufficient quality in that time. I do not want to ask for an extension, because I feel that I could be given another year and I still couldn't do it, due to a combination of complete lack of motivation, frankly lack of writing talent, and despair (my mental health really is very poor). I am obviously both very upset with myself, humiliated and despairing at where my life is now. I have spent a total of £25k this year on the Masters course and living standards for a qualification that a month in I realised I felt was a complete waste of time, and I have gained no skills from this, only more bad habits and misery. I have spent much money too on healthcare professionals trying to get a diagnosis for my issues. This has been wasted too, only ruling things out and leaving ALS to be slowly explored while I become increasingly weak and immobile. 

The only reason I am not homeless right now is because my parents have kindly let me stay in their property rent free, but that period ends soon so I will need to get a job. I am hoping to get a role cleaning or doing something mild but not stressful, however my muscles are so weak that I'm not sure I will be able to manage this. And of course given the cost of living this is not a long-term solution. I have thought about trying to get into coding, and wish in retrospect that I had just spent my savings (now all blown) on rent in a dive for a year teaching myself this instead of the Masters. 

I would be very grateful for some kind advice on how I might get my life back on track -in any and all areas (job, health, anything). My mental health is shot, my physical health is poor and slowly but relentlessly worsening (with it looking increasingly likely to be ALS) and I have no skills or talents that I have developed. I have no self-esteem and get no happiness from anything I do. I have few friends, a choppy relationship with my family and haven't had so much as a smile from the opposite sex in almost a decade. My quality of life is really very poor and I just need help.

329,"Hi,

I'm currently thinking about moving, I currently live in Maidstone, Kent, working as a Junior Software Developer earning £25k and living with my friend. I'm single at the moment, not sure if I'm really ready to look for a relationship as I'm feeling pretty stressed in my life at the moment, which is partially because of my job and feeling a bit stuck.

Tired of my job so looking to get a new one but from what I can see, the job market in Kent for software developers is awful and there is barely anything around - seems to be the same jobs being advertised for months, mostly from tiny companies, recruiters or webdev consultancies.

Obviously there is the ability to work remotely which is what I've been doing, but I'd probably want to go for a hybrid job as my social life is lacking and I'm really not learning much at my current job. Not sure how much I would make after a job move tbf but I have about 1.5 years experience with C#.

Ideally I'd like to move somewhere in the UK with a decent job market for software developers, I'd like to be able to live on my own as well if possible. Sadly it seems like living alone is a huge luxury at the moment? I don't really know anyone to move in with outside Kent, and not quite sure how I'd feel about moving in with strangers.

Ideally wouldn't want to move too far away from family, but I'm aware the cost of living in the North is a bit cheaper. I don't need to live somewhere with a huge amount of stuff going on, but it would be nice to live somewhere a bit more lively (and not full of chavs...)",Where to move to?,2022-09-13 18:50:41
330,"I'm making some comparison of costs of living over time, and it'd be great to say that a Latte at Starbucks costs you £XX now, but would have cost you £xx in 2007.

I was hoping to perhaps find old menus, or an archive of an website or such.

Any suggestions or help much appreciated!",Is there any way to find out the prices of a coffee in the UK in 2007?,2022-09-12 10:32:04
